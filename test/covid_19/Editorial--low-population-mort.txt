We read with interest the comments by Rhodes et al, and Panarese and Shahini, regarding a potential association between vitamin D levels and risk of severe coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19).1, 2 Their cogent arguments regarding low dose vitamin D supplementation during a period of lockdown, particularly in areas of low sunlight exposure and low baseline vitamin D levels, appear reasonable in the context of bone protection. However, whether this association carries forward to a protective effect against severe COVID-19 remains tenuous, and best regarded with caution.
