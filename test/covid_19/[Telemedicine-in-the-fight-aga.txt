The COVID-19 pandemic is bringing healthcare systems worldwide to the brink of collapse. One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections.

Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians.
