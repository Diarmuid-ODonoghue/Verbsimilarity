This study compared live instructor-led training in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) donning and doffing with video-based instruction. It assessed the difference in performance between (i) attending one instructor-led training session in donning and doffing PPE one month prior to assessment, and (ii) watching training videos over the month.
