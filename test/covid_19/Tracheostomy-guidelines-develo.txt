During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, tracheostomy may be required for COVID-19 patients requiring long-term ventilation in addition to other conditions such as airway compromise from head and neck cancer.

Performing surgical tracheostomy and tracheostomy care requires a strategy that mitigates these risks and maintains the quality of patient care.
