Older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk for dying of SARS CoV-2. In this periodof quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity (PA). This issue is important as the impact of a sedentarylifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but far more crucial for older adults. Indeed, they need to stay at homebecause they have a higher risk of a Covid-19 infection but they also need to avoid sedentarily. PA is important for older adults,especially to maintain their level of independence, their mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is,therefore, necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults.
