The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected tens of thousands of patients in China. Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr's law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr's law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence.
