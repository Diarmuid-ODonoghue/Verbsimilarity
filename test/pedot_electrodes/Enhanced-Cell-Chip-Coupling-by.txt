Interfacing soft materials with biological systems holds considerable promise for both biosensors and recording live cells. However, the interface between cells and organic substrates is not well studied, despite its crucial role in the effectiveness of the device. Furthermore, well-known cell adhesion enhancers, such as microgrooves, have not been implemented on these surfaces. Here, we present a nanoscale characterization of the cell-substrate interface for 3D laser-patterned organic electrodes by combining electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy/focused ion beam (SEM/FIB). We demonstrate that introducing 3D micropatterned grooves on organic surfaces enhances the cell adhesion of electrogenic cells.
