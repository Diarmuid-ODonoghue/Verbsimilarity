This study presents a new conducting polymer hydrogel (CPH) system, consisting of the synthetic hydrogel P(DMAA-co-5%MABP-co-2,5%SSNa) and the conducting polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), intended as coating material for neural interfaces. The composite material can be covalently attached to the surface electrode, can be patterned by a photolithographic process to influence selected electrode sites only and forms an interpenetrating network. The hybrid material was characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV), impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which confirmed a homogeneous distribution of PEDOT throughout all CPH layers. The CPH exhibited a 2,5 times higher charge storage capacity (CSC) and a reduced impedance when compared to the bare hydrogel. Electrochemical stability was proven over at least 1000 redox cycles. Non-toxicity was confirmed using an elution toxicity test together with a neuroblastoma cell-line. The described material shows great promise for surface modification of neural probes making it possible to combine the beneficial properties of the hydrogel with the excellent electronic properties necessary for high quality neural microelectrodes.
