In this work, flexible Te films have been synthesized by electrochemical deposition using PEDOT [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)] nanofilms as working electrodes. The Te electrodeposition time was varied to find the best thermoelectric properties of the Te/PEDOT double layers. To show the high quality of the Te films grown on PEDOT, the samples were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, showing the three Raman active modes of Te: E1, A1, and E2. The X-ray diffraction spectra also confirmed the presence of crystalline Te on top of the PEDOT films. The morphology of the Te/PEDOT films was studied using scanning electron microscopy, showing a homogeneous distribution of Te along the film. Also an atomic force microscope was used to analyze the quality of the Te surface. Finally, the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient of the Te/PEDOT films were measured as a function of the Te deposition time. The films showed an excellent thermoelectric behavior, giving a maximum power factor of about 320 ± 16 μW m-1 K-2 after 2.5 h of Te electrochemical deposition, a value larger than that reported for thin films of Te. Qualitative arguments to explain this behavior are given in the discussion.
