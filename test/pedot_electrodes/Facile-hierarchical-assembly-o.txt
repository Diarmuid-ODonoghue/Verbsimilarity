In this study, we successfully applied vapor-phase polymerization towards the synthesis of PEDOT nanofibers which were subsequently functionalized with gold particles and used as electrodes for electrochemical sensing. Two methods were used to synthesize the PEDOT nanofibers including (1) electrospinning followed by vapor-phase polymerization (EVP), and (2) one-step vapor-phase polymerization (OSVP). The average diameter of EVP fibers was approximately 350 nm, and OSVP was approximately 200 nm. Gold particles (âˆ¼500 nm) were synthesized by an oxidation-reduction reaction between gold precursors and residue EDOT monomers on the surface of the PEDOT nanofibers. In order to investigate the electrochemical performance of these electrodes, ascorbic acid was chosen as an analyte model. Our results indicated that PEDOT nanofiber electrodes showed an enhanced response with respect to bare gold electrodes. Furthermore, the OSVP PEDOT nanofibers with gold particles demonstrated the highest sensitivity at low ascorbic acid concentrations. These hierarchically assembled, gold particle-decorated, conductive polymer nanofibers were further fabricated into flexible electrodes, demonstrating a potential in advanced applications such as wearable electronics.
