Conducting polymer (CP) coatings on medical electrodes have the potential to provide superior performance when compared to conventional metallic electrodes, but their stability is strongly dependant on the substrate properties. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of laser roughening of underlying platinum (Pt) electrode surfaces on the mechanical, electrical and biological performance of CP coatings. In addition, the impact of dopant type on electrical performance and stability was assessed. The CP poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was coated on Pt microelectrode arrays, with three conventional dopant ions. The inÂ vitro electrical characteristics were assessed by cyclic voltammetry and biphasic stimulation. Results showed that laser roughening of the underlying substrate did not affect the charge injection limit of the coated material, but significantly improved the passive stability and chronic stimulation lifetime without failure of the coating. Accelerated material ageing and long-term biphasic stimulus studies determined that some PEDOT variants experienced delamination within as little as 10 days when the underlying Pt was smooth, but laser roughening to produce a surface index of 2.5 improved stability, such that more than 1.3 billion stimulation cycles could be applied without evidence of failure. PEDOT doped with paratoluene sulfonate (PEDOT/pTS) was found to be the most stable CP on roughened Pt, and presented a surface topography which encouraged neural cell attachment.
