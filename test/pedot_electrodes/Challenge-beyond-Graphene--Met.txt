Graphene has shown strong potential to occupy transparent electrodes, replacing indium tin oxide (ITO). However, the commercialization of graphene is still limited because of its poor chemical and electrical stability from reaction with environmental factors or essential materials such as poly[3,4-(ethylenedioxy)thiophene]:poly(styrenesulfonate) (
