We demonstrate locally contacted PEDOT:PSS Schottky diodes with excellent rectifying behavior, fabricated on n-type Si substrates using a spin-coating process and a reactive-ion etching process. Electrical transport characterizations of these Schottky diodes were investigated by both current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. We found that these devices exhibit excellent modulation in the current with an on/off ratio of - 10(6). Schottky junction solar cells composed of PEDOT:PSS and n-Si structures were also examined. From the current density-voltage (J-V) measurement of a solar cell under illumination, the short circuit current (I(sc)), open circuit voltage (V(oc)), and conversion efficiency (eta) were - 19.7 mA/cm2, - 578.5 mV, and - 6.5%, respectively. The simple and low-cost fabrication process of the PEDOT:PSS/n-Si Schottky junctions makes them a promising candidate for further high performance solar cell applications.
