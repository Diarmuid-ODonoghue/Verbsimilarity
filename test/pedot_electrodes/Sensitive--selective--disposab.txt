The fabrication of a novel, and highly selective electrochemical sensor based on a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) modified laser scribed graphene (LSG), and detection of dopamine (DA) in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) is described. LSG electrodes were produced with a 3-dimensional macro-porous network and large electrochemically-active surface area via direct laser writing on polyimide sheets. PEDOT was electrodeposited on the LSG electrode, and the physical properties of the obtained films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction microanalysis (EDAX). The modified electrodes were applied for the determination of DA in the presence of AA and UA using cyclic voltammetry (CV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. The linear range for dopamine detection was found to be 1-150 µM with a sensitivity of 0.220 ± 0.011 µA μM-1 and a detection limit of 0.33 µM; superior values to those obtained without PEDOT. For the first time, PEDOT-modified LSG have been fabricated and assessed for high-performance dopamine sensing using cost-effective, disposable electrodes, with potential for development in further sensing applications.
