Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is a promising conductive material widely used for interfacing with tissues in biomedical fields because of its unique properties. However, obtaining high charge injection capability and high stability remains challenging. In this study, pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by dopamine (DA) self-polymerization on the surface polydopamine (PDA@CNTs) were utilized as dopants of PEDOT to prepare hybrid films through electrochemical deposition on the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The PDA@CNTs-PEDOT film of the nanotube network topography exhibited excellent stability and strong adhesion to the ITO substrate compared with PEDOT and PEDOT/ p-toulene sulfonate. The PDA@CNTs-PEDOT-coated ITO electrodes demonstrated lower impedance and enhanced charge storage capacity than the bare ITO. When applying exogenous electrical stimulation (ES), robust long neurites sprouted from the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons cultured on the PDA@CNTs-PEDOT film. Moreover, ES promoted Schwann cell migration out from the DRG spheres and enhanced myelination. The PDA@CNTs-PEDOT film served as an excellent electrochemical sensor for the detection of DA in the presence of biomolecule interferences. Results would shed light into the advancement of conducting nanohybrids for applications in the multifunctional bioelectrode in neuroscience.
