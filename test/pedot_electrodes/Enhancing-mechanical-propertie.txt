The low mechanical durability of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been considered as one of the critical hurdles for their commercialization. We described a facile and powerful strategy for enhancing the mechanical properties of PSCs while maintaining their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) by using monodispersed polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs). We prepared highly monodispersed, size-controlled PS NPs (60, 80, and 100 nm), and used them to modify the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) anode buffer layer (ABL). The PS NPs played two important roles; i.e., they served as (1) binders in the PEDOT:PSS films, and (2) interfacial modifiers between ABL and the active layer, resulting in remarkable improvement of the mechanical integrity of the PSCs. The addition of PS NPs enhanced the inherent mechanical toughness of the PEDOT:PSS ABL due to their elastic properties, allowing the modified ABL to tolerate higher mechanical deformations. In addition, the adhesion energy (Gc) between the active layer and the modified PEDOT:PSS layer was enhanced significantly, i.e., by a factor of more than 1.5. The Gc value has a strong relationship with the sizes of the PS NP, showing the greatest enhancement when the largest size PS NPs (100 nm) were used. In addition, PS NPs significantly improve the air-stability of the PSCs by suppressing moisture adsorption and corrosion of the electrodes. Thus, the modification of ABL with PS NPs effectively enhances both the mechanical and the long-term stabilities of the PSCs without sacrificing their PCE values, demonstrating their great potential as applications in flexible organic electronics.
