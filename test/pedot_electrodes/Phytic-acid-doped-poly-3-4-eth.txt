A nanocomposite consisting of phytic acid (PA) that was doped with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) (PEDOT) and modified with copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) was placed on a glassy carbon electrode and then applied in an enzymeless glucose sensor. The undulating PEDOT/PA composite has good conductivity and a large surface area, which was suitable as substrate for the uniform growth of CuNPs. The modified electrode typically operated at a potential near 0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity towards direct oxidation of glucose in NaOH solution (the major limitation of this sensor). Figures of merit include (a) a wide analytical range (5 to 403 μM); (b) high sensitivity (79.27 μA·μM-1·cm-2), (c) a low detection limit (0.28 μM at a signal to noise ratio of 3), and (d) fast response (< 4 s). Graphical abstractA nanocomposite of phytic acid (PA) doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) (PEDOT) modified with copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) onto a glassy carbon electrode was prepared by electrochemical strategy. The CuNPs/PEDOT/PA-modified electrodes were applied in enzymeless glucose sensors with high performance.
