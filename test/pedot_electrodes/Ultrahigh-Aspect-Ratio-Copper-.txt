Copper nanowires (CuNWs) with ultrahigh aspect ratio are synthesized with a solution process and spray-coated onto select substrates to fabricate transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs). Different annealing methods are investigated and compared for effectiveness and convenience. The CuNWs are subsequently combined with the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (
