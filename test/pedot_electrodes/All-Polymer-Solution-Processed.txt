The growing range of applications for optoelectronic and electrochromic devices (ECDs) encourages the search for materials combining high electrical conductivity with optical transparency. Next generation transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) are required to be inexpensive, lightweight, scalable, and compatible with flexible substrates to trigger innovations towards supporting sustainable living and reducing energy consumption. Here we show that PEDOT:PSS can be solution processed using blade coating and subsequently post-treated with nitric and acetic acid to raise its conductivity above 2000 S cm-1 with a film transparency of âˆ¼95%. A combined grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering, atomic force microscopy, and thickness analysis of the film indicates that the removal of excess insulating PSS- inducing reordering is the critical parameter for the claimed conductivity increase. We then investigate the impact of replacing indium tin oxide electrodes with PEDOT:PSS in ECDs. While electrochromic contrast and optical memory are comparable for devices constructed with both electrode materials, differences in switching kinetics are explored by comparing internal resistances, ion diffusion, and charging effects in the polymer films extracted by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. While all these ideas are described based on a battery-type ECD configuration, these concepts are easily transferable to other types of redox-active devices.
