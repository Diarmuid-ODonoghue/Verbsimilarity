We present here an electrochemical sensor microsystem for the monitoring of pH. The all-polymeric device is comprised of a cyclic olefin copolymer substrate, a 200 nm-thin patterned layer of conductive polymer (PEDOT), and a 70 nm electropolymerized layer of a pH sensitive conductive polymer (polyaniline). The patterning of the fluidic (microfluidic channels) and conductive (wiring and electrodes) functional elements was achieved with a single soft PDMS mold via a single embossing step process. A post-processing treatment with ethylene glycol assured the functional enhancement of the electrodes, as demonstrated via an electrical and electrochemical characterization. A surface modification of the electrodes was carried out, based on voltammetric electropolymerization, to obtain a thin layer of polyaniline. The mechanism for pH sensing is based on the redox reactions of the polyaniline layer caused by protonation. The sensing performance of the microsystem was finally validated by monitoring its potentiometric response upon exposure to a relevant range of pH.
