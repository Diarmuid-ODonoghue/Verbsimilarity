Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) composite-derived carbon exhibiting large surface area and high micropore volume is demonstrated to be a promising electrode material for the capacitive deionization (CDI) application. However, some inherent serious issues (e.g., low electrical conductivity, narrow pore size, relatively low pore volume, etc.) are still observed for nitrogen-doped porous carbon particles, which restrict their CDI performance. To solve the above-mentioned problems, herein, we prepared gold-nanoparticle-embedded ZIF-8-derived nitrogen-doped carbon calcined at 800 Â°C (Au@NC800) and PEDOT doped-NC-800 (NC800-PEDOT). The newly generated NC800-PEDOT and Au@NC800 electrodes exhibited notably increased conductivity, and they also achieved high electrosorption capacities of 16.18 mg g-1 and 14.31 mg g-1, respectively, which were much higher than that of NC800 (8.36 mg g-1). Au@NC800 and NC800-PEDOT can be promisingly applicable as highly efficient CDI electrode materials.
