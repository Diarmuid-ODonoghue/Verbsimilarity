We reported a facile solution-processed method to fabricate a MoSx anode buffer layer through thermal decomposition of (NH4)2MoS4. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on in situ growth MoSx as the anode buffer layer showed impressive improvements, and the power conversion efficiency was higher than that of conventional PEDOT:PSS-based device. The MoSx films obtained at different temperatures and the corresponding device performance were systematically studied. The results indicated that both MoS3 and MoS2 were beneficial to the device performance. MoS3 could result in higher Voc, while MoS2 could lead to higher Jsc. Our results proved that, apart from MoO3, molybdenum sulfides and Mo(4+) were also promising candidates for the anode buffer materials in OSCs.
