Solid-contact (SC) ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) utilizing thin films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and plasticized poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) have been produced using a spin casting procedure. This study was carried out with a view of characterizing this popular and well known SC ISE using a series of complementary surface analysis techniques. This work revealed that PEDOT:PSS prevents the separation of an undesirable water layer at the buried interface of this SC ISE due to the high miscibility of water in the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS layer. The lack of a clearly defined and molecularly sharp buried interface prohibits the formation of a distinct water layer presumably by eliminating sites that promote the accumulation of water. This outcome is important to the chemical sensor community since it provides further insights into the compatibility of sensor components in SC ISEs.
