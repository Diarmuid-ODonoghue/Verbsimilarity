Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are assembled from a complex ensemble of layers of disparate materials, each playing a distinct role within the device. In this work, the role of the interface that bridges the transparent anode and the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in an OPV device was investigated. The surface characteristics of the electrode interface affect the energy level alignment, phase segregation, and the local composition of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ), which is in close contact. The commonly used ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode was tailored with a thin, low-band-gap polymer overlayer, called PBDTTPD-COOH, a variant of the established donor polymer, PBDTTPD. Three BHJs that were composed of a donor polymer and PC71BM, were examined, including the donor polymers PBDTTPD, PCDTBT, and PTB7, within the following OPV device stack: ITO/(interfacial layer or layers)/BHJ/LiF/Al/Mg. It was found that modification of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode with PBDTTPD-COOH resulted in statistically significant increases of power conversion efficiency for the PBDTTPD- and PCDTBT-based donor polymer:PC71BM BHJs, but not for the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) enabled determination of the respective energy level diagrams for these three different polymers relative to the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTPD-COOH electrode, and revealed no injection barrier in all three polymer/substrate pairs. The observed differences of efficiency were not, therefore, electronic in origin. ToF-SIMS depth profiling and detailed experiments to determine surface energies strongly suggested that the greatest factor influencing device performance was a significant change of the local composition of the BHJ at this interface.
