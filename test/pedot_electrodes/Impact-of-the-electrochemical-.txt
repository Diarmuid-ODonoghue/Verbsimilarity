Conditions of electrodeposition, i.e. a potential window of the process, addition of water, the current density, and morphology of substrate electrodes (Pt, Pt/TiO(2), Au), were shown to influence strongly ion-exchange properties of polypyrrole (PPy) synthesized in propylene carbonate (PC), doped with ClO(4)(-) or p-toluenesulfonate (TOS(-)). "Electrochemical porosity" and redox activity of PPy films were compared to the characteristics of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). A molecular indicator of the PPy film structure packing was bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI(-)). Ion-exchange properties of PPy were found to be almost independent of chemical composition of the polymer, described in the literature as PPy(I), PPy(II), PPy(III). Instead, micro- and nanoscopic morphology of the polymer film and a molecular level packing of the polymer chains as well as the counterion nature are of the foremost importance. The polymer film structure/properties are shown to change upon prolonged redox/ionic stimulations. Lithium exchange between PPy films and contacting phases (PC electrolyte, TiO(2)) proceeds in addition to the anion exchange, the latter being a dominant process under conditions of the reversible electrochemical p-doping of PPy, although diffusion coefficients of PC solvated lithium ions in PPy are higher than diffusion coefficients of perchlorate, p-toluenesulfonate or bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anions. The highest flux of Li(+) ions into/out of the PPy phase takes place about -1.0 V vs Ag/Ag(+) which is clearly evidenced by the cathodic/anodic CV peaks. Cation transport phenomena can be analyzed independently from anion transport when observed at a longer time scale (low values of potential scan rate) as each prevails at different redox states of the polymer. However, in a shorter time scale (v > or = 10 mV s(-1)), the opposite fluxes of cations and anions were observed to interfere. Furthermore, a net uptake of propylene carbonate by the as grown PPy film occurs at initial cycles of the cation uptake causing irreversible swelling of the polymer phase. Mechanisms of the redox process and accompanying mass transport involving PPy films were investigated using comparatively three techniques: cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM).
