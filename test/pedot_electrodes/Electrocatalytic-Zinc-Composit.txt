Highly efficient zinc compounds (Zn3N2, ZnO, ZnS, and ZnSe) have been investigated as low-cost electrocatalysts for the counter electrodes (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Among them, Zn3N2 and ZnSe are introduced for the first time in DSSCs. The zinc compounds were separately mixed with a conducting binder, poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (
