Flexible and transparent electrodes have great potential for photon transmission and charge-carrier collection for next generation electronics compared to rigid electronics with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates. This study describes a comprehensive study of the electrical, morphological, optical, structural, and mechanical properties of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (
