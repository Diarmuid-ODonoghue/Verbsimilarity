An in-house UV lithography setup has been optimized to fabricate low-cost disposable electrochemical sensing Cu electrodes using a copper clad board. In view of the high oxidation probability of copper, the low-cost electrodes were modified using different gold nanostructures and a conducing polymer PEDOT:PSS to attain maximal signal output and improved shelf-life. Zero-dimensional (0D) gold nanoparticles (∼40 nm) and three-dimensional (3D) gold nanoflowers (∼38 nm) mixed with PEDOT:PSS were used as signal-enhancing conductors for the ultrasensitive detection of our model contaminant, methylene blue dye (MB). The bare copper electrode was sensitive to MB, linearly within the range of 4-100 μM, with a limit of detection of 3.49 μM. While for gold nanoparticle-PEDOT:PSS-modified electrode, the sensitivity of the electrode was found to increase linearly in the range of 0.01-0.1 μM, and for gold nanoflowers-PEDOT:PSS, the sensitivity achieved was 0.01-0.1 μM with the LOD as 0.0022 μM. For a PEDOT:PSS-modified Cu electrode, used as a comparative to study the contributing role of gold nanostructures towards improved sensitivity, the linearity was found to be in the range of 0.1-1.9 μM with the LOD as 0.0228 μM. A 6 times improvement in signal sensitivity for the nanoflower-PEDOT:PSS electrode compared to the nanoparticle-PEDOT:PSS-modified electrode indicates the influence of nanoparticle shape on the electrode efficiency. 3D gold nanoflowers with a large surface area-to-volume ratio and a high catalytic activity prove to be a superior choice for electrode modification.
