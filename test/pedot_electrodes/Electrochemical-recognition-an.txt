The electrochemical recognition and trace-level detection of bactericide carbendazim (MBC) in paddy water and commercial juice were realized using carboxylic group functionalized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PC4-EDOT-COOH) film electrode. PC4-EDOT-COOH film was prepared by one step, low-cost, and green electrosynthesis in aqueous microemulsion system and characterized by FT-IR, cyclic voltammetry, UV-vis and SEM. In comparison with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(hydroxymethylated-3,4-ethylenedioxylthiophene) (PEDTM), PC4-EDOT-COOH exhibited the best electrochemical recognition towards MBC and the recognition mechanism was proved by quantitative calculation. Sensing parameters such as pH values, accumulation potential, accumulation time, supporting electrolyte, and scan rate on the current response of MBC were discussed. In addition, the sensor can be applied to quantification of MBC in the concentration range of 0.012-0.35 Î¼M with a low detection limit of 3.5 nM (S/N=3). Moreover, PC4-EDOT-COOH film electrode showed good stability, high selectivity, and satisfactory anti-interference ability. Satisfactory results indicated that PC4-EDOT-COOH film is a promising sensing platform for the trace-level analysis of bactericide residue carbendazim in agricultural crops and environment.
