A stringent limitation in many optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells and light emitting diodes, is the intrinsic need for a transparent electrode. Uniting relevant aspects, indium tin oxide (ITO) is often the material of choice, however, alternatives are sought and being in particular found in conductive polymers. In this work, we present a novel doping strategy to arrive at highly conducting polymeric material based on poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT). Based on commercial high conductivity PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH 1000), and a post processing with aqueous triflic acid delivers a material that is both transparent and of low resistivity (5.23 × 10-4 Ω cm). Furthermore, this material retains its conductive character over a large temperature range, indicating metallic behaviour. This is further supported by positive magnetoconductance effects at low temperatures (1.8-10 K) and extended mean free paths of the conduction electrons are observed-evidencing for a metallic state in this polymer.
