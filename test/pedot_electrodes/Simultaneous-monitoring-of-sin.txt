Continuous and long-term monitoring of cellular and micro-organ activity is required for new insights into physiology and novel technologies such as Organs-on-Chip. Moreover, recent advances in stem cell technology and especially in the field of diabetes call for non-invasive approaches in quality testing of the large quantities of surrogate pancreatic islets to be generated. Electrical activity of such a micro-organ results in single cell action potentials (APs) of high frequency and in low frequency changes in local field potentials (slow potentials or SPs), reflecting coupled cell activity and overall organ physiology. Each of them is indicative of different physiological stages in islet activation. Action potentials in islets are of small amplitude and very difficult to detect. The use of PEDOT:PSS to coat metal electrodes is expected to reduce noise and results in a frequency-dependent change in impedance, as shown here. Whereas detection of high-frequency APs improves, low frequency SPs are less well detected which is, however, an acceptable trade off in view of the strong amplitude of SPs. Using a dedicated software, recorded APs and SPs can be automatically diagnosed and analyzed. Concomitant capture of the two signals will considerably increase the diagnostic power of monitoring islets and islet surrogates in fundamental research as well as drug screening or the use of islets as biosensors.
