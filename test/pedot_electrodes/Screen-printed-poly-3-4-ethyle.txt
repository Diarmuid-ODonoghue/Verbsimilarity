This work describes the use of a PEDOT:PSS-based conductive polymer for designing AChE-based biosensors. The transducers were obtained directly by screen-printing a PEDOT:PSS suspension on the surface of thick film carbon electrodes. The obtained working electrodes showed a high conductivity when compared with electrodes modified with conventional mediators like cobalt phthalocyanine or tetracyanoquinodimethane. The PEDOT:PSS polymer was shown to be suitable for thiocholine oxidation, allowing the measurement of AChE activity at 100 mV vs Ag/AgCl. The high conductivity of PEDOT:PSS allowed the accurate detection of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos-oxon at concentrations as low as 4x10(-9)M, corresponding to an inhibition ratio of 5%.
