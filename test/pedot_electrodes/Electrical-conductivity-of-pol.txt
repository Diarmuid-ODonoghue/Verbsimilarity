Reduced graphene oxide-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):p-toluene sulfonate (rGO-PEDOT:PTS) hybrid electrode films were synthesized directly on a substrate by interfacial polymerization between an oxidizing solid layer and liquid droplets of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) produced by electrospraying. The EDOT reduced the graphene oxide by donating electrons during its transformation into PEDOT:PTS, and hybrid films consisting of rGO distributed in a matrix of PEDOT:PTS were obtained. These rGO-PEDOT:PTS hybrid films showed excellent electrical conductivities as high as 1,500 S/cm and a sheet resistance of 70 Ω sq(-1). The conductivity values are up to 50% greater than those of films containing conductive PEDOT:PTS alone. These results confirm that highly conductive rGO-PEDOT:PTS hybrid films can potentially be used as organic transparent electrodes.
