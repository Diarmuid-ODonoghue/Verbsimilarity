Despite surface electrodes technology for biopotential recording is well established, different researches are aimed at overcoming the limitations exhibited by the available solutions. In this paper, a proposal for the low-cost development of textile electrodes based on woven fabrics treated with polymer poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (
