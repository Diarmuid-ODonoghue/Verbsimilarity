The ZnO homogeneous pn junction photodiode is quite difficult to fabricate due to the absence of stable p-type ZnO. So exploring reliable p-type materials is necessary to build a heterogeneous pn junction with n-type ZnO. Herein, we develop a simple and low-cost solution-processed method to obtain inorganic p-type CuI/CuSCN composite film with compact morphology, high conductivity, and low surface state. The improved performance of CuI/CuSCN composite film can be confirmed based on high-rectification ratio, responsivity, and open voltage of ZnO-CuI/CuSCN photodiode UV detectors. Moreover, photodiodes with novel top electrodes are investigated. Compared with commonly used Au and graphene/Ag nanowire (NWs) electrode, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (
