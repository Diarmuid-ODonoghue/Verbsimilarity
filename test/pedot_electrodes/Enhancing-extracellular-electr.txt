Electron transfer efficiency in electroactive biofilm is the limiting factor for bioelectricity output of bioelectrochemical system. Here, carbon felt (CF) is coated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) which acts as electron mediator in electroactive biofilm. A wrapping layer of conducting Poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene is developed to protect the MnO2 and enhance electron transfer efficiency of MnO2 mediator. The hybrid bioanode (PEDOT/MnO2/CF bioanode) delivered the highest electron transfer efficiency (6.3 × 10-9 mol cm-2 s-1/2) and the highest capacitance of 4.78 F, much higher than bare CF bioanode (1.50 ± 0.04 × 10-9 mol cm-2 s-1/2 and 0.42 F). As a result, microbial fuel cells could produce a maximum power density of 1534 ± 13 mW m-2, approximately 57.7% higher than that with the bare carbon felt anode (972 ± 21 mW m-2). Possible mechanisms are proposed to help understanding the different function of the PEDOT and MnO2 on the anodic layer. This study introduces an effective method for the fabrication of high performance anode.
