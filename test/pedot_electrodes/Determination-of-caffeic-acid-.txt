A novel method using PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy) thiophene) modified electrode was developed for the determination of caffeic acid (CA) in wine. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the additions standard method was used to quantify the analyte at PEDOT modified electrodes. PEDOT films were electrodeposited on Platinum electrode (Pt) in aqueous medium by galvanostatic method using sodium poly(styrene-4-sulfonate) (PSS) as electrolyte and surfactant. CV allows detecting the analyte over a wide concentration range (10.0nmoll(-1)-6.5mmoll(-1)). The electrochemical method proposed showed good statistical and analytical parameters as linearity range, LOD, LOQ and sensitivity.
