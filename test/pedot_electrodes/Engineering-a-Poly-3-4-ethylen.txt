The surface properties of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):(polystyrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) affect the performance of many organic electronic devices. The work function determines the efficiency of the charge carrier transfer between PEDOT:PSS electrodes and the active layer of the device. The surface free energy affects phase separation in multicomponent blends that are typically used to fabricate active layers of organic light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices. Here, we present a method to prepare PEDOT:PSS films with a gradient work function and surface free energy. This modification was achieved by evaporation of trimethoxy(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silane in such a way that the degree of surface coverage of the molecules varied in the selected direction. Gradient films were used as electrodes to fabricate two-terminal PEDOT:PSS/poly(3-hexyl thiophene)/Au devices to rapidly screen for the influence of the modification on the performance of the prepared polymer diodes. Gradual changes in the morphology of the solution-cast model poly(3-butyl thiophene)/poly-bromostyrene films followed changes in the surface energy of the substrate.
