Electrophysiological biosensors embedded in planar devices represent a state of the art approach to measure and evaluate the electrical activity of biological systems. This measurement method allows for the testing of drugs and their influences on cells or tissues, cytotoxicity, as well as the direct implementation into biological systems in vivo for signal transduction. Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) with metal or metal-like electrodes on glass substrates are one of the most common, well-established platforms for this purpose. In recent years organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) made of poly(2,3-dihydrothieno-1,4-dioxin)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have as well shown their value in transducing and amplifying the ionic signals in biological systems. We developed OECT devices in a wafer-scale process and used them as electrophysiological biosensors measuring electrophysiological activity of the cardiac cell line HL-1. Our optimized devices show very promising properties such as good signal-to-noise ratio as well as the ability to record fast components of extracellular signals. Combined with an easy, cost effective fabrication and the transparency of the polymer, this platform offers a valuable alternative to traditional MEA systems for future cell sensing applications.
