Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films were electrodeposited by cyclic voltammetry on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in aqueous solution. Three kinds of supporting electrolytes were used, viz. graphene oxide (GO), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and GO in PBS, respectively. The surface morphology of the modified electrodes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical performance of the modified electrodes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy by using the hexacyanoferrate redox system. The results demonstrate that the PEDOT-GO/GCE, which was electropolymerized in aqueous solutions containing EDOT and GO, shows the best electrochemical activities compared with other modified electrodes. The electrochemical behaviors of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA) were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The PEDOT-GO/GCE exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activities towards these important biomolecules. Under physiological pH conditions and in the mixed system of AA, DA and UA, the modified GCE exhibits the following figures of merit: (a) a linear voltammetric response in the concentration ranges of 100-1000 μM for AA, 6.0-200 μM for DA, and 40-240 μM for UA; (b) well separated oxidation peaks near 31, 213 and 342 mV (vs. saturated Ag/AgCl) for AA, DA and UA, respectively; and (c) detection of limits (at S/N = 3) of 20, 2.0 and 10 μM. The results demonstrate that GO, based on its relatively large number of anionic sites, can be used as the sole weak electrolyte and charge balance dopant for the preparation of functionally doped conducting polymers by electrodeposition.
