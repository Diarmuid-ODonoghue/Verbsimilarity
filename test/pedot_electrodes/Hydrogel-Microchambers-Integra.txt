A hydrogel-based microchamber with organic electrodes for efficient electrical stimulations of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) is described. The microchamber is made from molecularly permeable, optically transparent, and electrically conductive polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel and highly capacitive carbon electrode modified with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Spheroids of hiPSC-CMs are cultured in microchambers, and electrically stimulated by the electrode for maturation. The large interfacial capacitance of the electrodes enables several days of electrical stimulation without generation of cytotoxic bubbles even when the electrodes are placed near the spheroids. The spheroids can be cultivated in the closed microchambers because of the permeated nutrients through the hydrogel, thus the spheroids are stably addressable and the culture medium around the sealed microchambers can be simply exchanged. Synchronized beating of the spheroids can be optically analyzed in situ, which makes it possible to selectively collect electrically responsive cells for further use. As the hydrogel is electrically conductive, the amount of electrical charge needed for maturing the spheroids can be reduced by configuring electrodes on the top and the bottom of the microchamber. The bioreactor will be useful for efficient production of matured hiPSC-CMs for regenerative medicine and drug screening.
