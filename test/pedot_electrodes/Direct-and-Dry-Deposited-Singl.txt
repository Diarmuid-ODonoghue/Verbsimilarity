Organic solar cells have been regarded as a promising electrical energy source. Transparent and conductive carbon nanotube film offers an alternative to commonly used ITO in photovoltaics with superior flexibility. This communication reports carbon nanotube-based indium-free organic solar cells and their flexible application. Direct and dry deposited carbon nanotube film doped with MoO(x) functions as an electron-blocking transparent electrode, and its performance is enhanced further by overcoating with
