A prerequisite for exploiting sensing devices based on semiconductor nanowires is ultra-sensitive and selective direct electrical detection of biological and chemical species. Here, we constructed a transducer based on copolymer of poly(3,4,-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and carboxylic group functionalised PEDOT single nanowire in between gold electrodes, followed by covalent attachment of amino-modified probe oligonucleotide. The target ODNs specific to Homo sapiens Breast and ovarian cancer cells were detected at femtomolar concentration and incorporation of negative controls (non-complementary ODN) were clearly discriminated by the sensor. The ex situ measurements were performed by using two terminal device setup and the changes in the interface of the nanowire associated with the association or dissociation of ODNs were measured as change in resistance. In addition, in situ measurements were performed by utilizing scanning ion conductance microscopy to measure the change in resistance of probe modified nanowire upon addition of different concentration of target ODNs in presence of relevant buffer. The constructed, nano sensor showed highly sensitive concentration dependent resistance change.
