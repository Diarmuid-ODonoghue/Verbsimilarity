In order to address material limitations of biologically interfacing electrodes, modified silica nanoparticles are utilized as dopants for conducting polymers. Silica precursors are selected to form a thiol modified particle (TNP), following which the particles are oxidized to sulfonate modified nanoparticles (SNPs). The selective inclusion of hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide allows for synthesis of both porous and nonporous SNPs. Nonporous nanoparticle doped polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) films possess low interfacial impedance, high charge injection (4.8 mC cm-2 ), and improved stability under stimulation compared to PEDOT/poly(styrenesulfonate). Porous SNP dopants can serve as drug reservoirs and greatly enhance the capability of conducting polymer-based, electrically controlled drug release technology. Using the SNP dopants, drug loading and release is increased up to 16.8 times, in addition to greatly expanding the range of drug candidates to include both cationic and electroactive compounds, all while maintaining their bioactivity. Finally, the PEDOT/SNP composite is capable of precisely modulating neural activity in vivo by timed release of a glutamate receptor antagonist from coated microelectrode sites. Together, this work demonstrates the feasibility and potential of doping conducting polymers with engineered nanoparticles, creating countless options to produce composite materials for enhanced electrical stimulation, neural recording, chemical sensing, and on demand drug delivery.
