Various metals for the cathode electrode of organic electronic devices have been used in order to improve carrier injection and contact resistance etc. However, metal electrodes have some disadvantages such as rough surfaces, inadequate interfacial durability and unsuitable work functions. In the present work, we have fabricated an organic photovoltaic cell consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/DMDCNQI/Al. The dimmethyldicyanoquinonediimine (DMDCNQI) compound was used as an organic n-type charge transfer complex between the cathode electrode and an organic active layer to improve contact resistance and electron transport ability. The prepared device shows a high short-circuit current density of 10.39 mA/cm2 and a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.10%.
