Simultaneous detection of multiple tumor biomarkers in body fluids could facilitate early diagnosis of lung cancer, so as to provide scientific reference for clinical treatment. This paper depicted a multi-parameter paper-based electrochemical aptasensor for simultaneous detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in a clinical sample with high sensitivity and specificity. The paper-based device was fabricated through wax printing and screen-printing, which enabled functions of sample filtration and sample auto injection. Amino functional graphene (NG)-Thionin (THI)- gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and Prussian blue (PB)- poly (3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)- AuNPs nanocomposites were synthesized respectively. They were used to modify the working electrodes not only for promoting the electron transfer rate, but also for immobilization of the CEA and NSE aptamers. A label-free electrochemical method was adopted, enabling a rapid simple point-of-care testing. Experimental results showed that the proposed multi-parameter aptasensor exhibited good linearity in ranges of 0.01-500 ng mL-1 for CEA (R2 = 0.989) and 0.05-500 ng mL-1 for NSE (R2 = 0.944), respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was 2 pg mL-1 for CEA and 10 pg mL-1 for NSE. In addition, the device was evaluated using clinical serum samples and received a good correlation with large electrochemical luminescence (ECL) equipment, which would offer a new platform for early cancer diagnostics, especially in those resource-limit areas.
