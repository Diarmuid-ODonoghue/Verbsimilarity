The development of coating materials for neural interfaces has been a pursued to improve the electrical, mechanical and biological performances. For these goals, a bioactive coating was developed in this work featuring a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite and covalently bonded YIGSR and RGD. Its biological effect and electrical characteristics were assessed in vivo on microwire arrays (MWA). The coated electrodes exhibited a significantly higher charge storage capacity (CSC) and lower electrochemical impedance at 1 kHz which are desired to improve the stimulating and recording performances, respectively. Acute neural recording experiments revealed that coated MWA possess a higher signal/noise ratio capturing spikes undetected by uncoated electrodes. Moreover, coated MWA possessed more active sites and single units, and the noise floor of coated electrodes was lower than that of uncoated electrodes. There is little information in the literature concerning the chronic performance of bioactively modified neural interfaces in vivo. Therefore in this work, chronic in vivo tests were conducted and the PEDOT/PSS/MWCNT-polypeptide coated arrays exhibited excellent performances with the highest mean maximal amplitude from day 4 to day 12 during which the acute response severely compromised the performance of the electrodes. In brief, we developed a simple method of covalently bonding YIGSR and RGD to a PEDOT/PSS/MWCNT-COOH composite improving both the biocompatibility and electrical performance of the neural interface. Our findings suggest that YIGSR and RGD modified PEDOT/PSS/MWCNT is a promising bioactivated composite coating for neural recording and stimulating.
