In this study, we have investigated the contribution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the durability of the electrochemically synthesized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) film on a platinum (Pt) electrode. The electrode was capable to effectively adsorb the nano Au particles (AuNPs) to form a uniform layout, which was then able to immobilize the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to construct a functional HRP/AuNPs/PEDOT(BSA)/Pt biosensor. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to evaluate the performance of the biosensor through the measurement of hydrogen peroxide. Our results revealed a satisfied linear correlation between the cathodic current and the concentration of H2O2. Furthermore, the addition of oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD‚Å∫, as the electron transfer mediator in the detection solution could dramatically enhance the sensitivity of detection by about 35.5%. The main advantages of the current biosensor are its durability, sensitivity, reliability, and biocompatibility.
