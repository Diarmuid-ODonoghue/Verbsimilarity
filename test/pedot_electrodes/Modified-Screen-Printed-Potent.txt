Screen-printed platforms integrated with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) were fabricated and characterized as potentiometric sensors for diquat (DQ). The synthesized MIP beads were studied as sensory carriers in plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) membranes. The sensors were constructed by using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as solid-contact material to diminish charge-transfer resistance and water layer potential. Conventional ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) with internal filling solution were used for comparison. The designed electrodes showed near Nernstian slopes of 28.2 ± 0.7 (r² = 0.999) over the concentration range of 1.0 × 10-6-1.0 × 10-2 M with the limit of detection 0.026 µg/mL over the pH range 4.2-9.0. The electrode exhibited good selectivity for diquat cations over a large number of organic and inorganic cations. The sensor was successfully introduced for direct measurement of diquat content in commercial pesticide preparations and different spiked potato samples. The results showed that the proposed electrode has a fast and stable response, good reproducibility, and applicability for direct assessment of diquat content. The proposed potentiometric method is simple and accurate in comparison with the reported HPLC methods. Besides, it is applicable to turbid and colored sample solutions.
