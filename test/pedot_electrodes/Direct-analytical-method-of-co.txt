Poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) polymerized with poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) is one of the most widely used conducting organic electrodes owing to its outstanding optical/electrical properties and high work function. Because its work function depends significantly on the molecular arrangements between PEDOT and PSS molecules on the surface, the contact position of
