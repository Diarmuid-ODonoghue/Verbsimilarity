This paper reports on three-dimensional synchrotron radiation/Fourier transform-infrared microspectroscopy (SR/FT-IRM) imaging studies of water inclusions at the buried interface of solid-contact-ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs). It is our intention to describe a nondestructive method that may be used in surface studies of the buried interfaces of materials, especially multilayers of polymers. Herein, we demonstrate the power of SR/FT-IRM for studying water inclusions at the buried interfaces of SC-ISEs. A poly(methyl methacrylate)-poly(decyl methacyrlate) [PMMA-PDMA] copolymer revealed the presence of micrometer sized inclusions of water at the gold/membrane interface, while a coupling of a hydrophobic solid contact of poly(3-octylthiophene 2,5-diyl) (POT) prevented the accumulation of water at the buried interface. A similar study with a poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly (styrenesulfonate) [PEDOT/PSS] solid contact also revealed an absence of distinct micrometer-sized pools of water; however, there were signs of absorption of water accompanied by swelling of the PEDOT/PSS underlayer, and these membrane zones are enriched with respect to water.
