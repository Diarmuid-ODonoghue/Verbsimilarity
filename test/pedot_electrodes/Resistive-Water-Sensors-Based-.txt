Water sensors are a type of level sensor that can be used in various applications requiring the sensing of water levels, such as in dams, nuclear power plants, water pipes, water tanks, and dehumidifiers. In particular, water sensors in water ingress monitoring systems (WIMS) protect lives and property from disasters caused by water leakage and flooding. Here, a resistive water sensor for WIMS that incorporates poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythinophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (PEGME) (PEDOT:PSS-g-PEGME copolymer) as high-conductivity electrodes and laser-treated PEDOT:PSS-g-PEGME copolymer as the low-conductivity resistive component is reported. The configuration of the water sensor is modeled as two parallel resistors (Rlaser treated PEDOT:PSS||Rwater) when water comes into contact with the sensor surface. The two-resistor configuration exhibits a better performance in comparison with single-resistor configurations comprising only PEDOT:PSS-g-PEGME copolymer or laser-treated PEDOT:PSS-g-PEMGE copolymer. Moreover, PEDOT:PSS-g-PEGME copolymer is applied to the sensor to improve the stability of PEDOT:PSS in water. We demonstrate that the sensor can detect the water level in real time with high sensitivity and accuracy, and thus has potential in applications for monitoring water-related hazards.
