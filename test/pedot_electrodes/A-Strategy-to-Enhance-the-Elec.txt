In this article, three-dimensional (3D) microstuctured poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) composite electrodes with varying amount of PEDOT loadings were successfully prepared by electrochemical deposition method. The composites were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cyclic voltammetry. Raman spectra suggest that there is a strong interaction between the RVC and backbone of PEDOT chain. It is revealed from the SEM images that the PEDOT amount, thickness, surface roughness, porosity, and globular structure on RVC electrode are increased with the increase in polymerization time. The capacitance of PEDOT/RVC electrode has increased by a factor of 2230 compared to a bare RVC electrode when polymerization is carried out for 120 min. Moreover, the capacitance of PEDOT was found to be very high compared with other PEDOT studies. The electrodes also show good cyclic stability. This substantial increase in capacitance of RVC electrode is due to the rough, highly porous, and honeycomb-like fine structure of PEDOT coating, which shows a flower-like morphology, consisting of numerous thin flakes with numbers of macropores and micropores. This interesting morphology has enhanced the performance of PEDOT because of increased electrode surface area, specific capacitance, and macroporous structure of RVC electrode.
