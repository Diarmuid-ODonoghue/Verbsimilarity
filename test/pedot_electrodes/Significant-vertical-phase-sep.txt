In the present study, a novel polar-solvent vapor annealing (PSVA) was used to induce a significant structural rearrangement in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films in order to improve their electrical conductivity and work function. The effects of polar-solvent vapor annealing on PEDOT:PSS were systematically compared with those of a conventional solvent additive method (SAM) and investigated in detail by analyzing the changes in conductivity, morphology, top and bottom surface composition, conformational PEDOT chains, and work function. The results confirmed that PSVA induces significant phase separation between excess PSS and PEDOT chains and a spontaneous formation of a highly enriched PSS layer on the top surface of the PEDOT:PSS polymer blend, which in turn leads to better 3-dimensional connections between the conducting PEDOT chains and higher work function. The resultant PSVA-treated PEDOT:PSS anode films exhibited a significantly enhanced conductivity of up to 1057 S cm(-1) and a tunable high work function of up to 5.35 eV. The PSVA-treated PEDOT:PSS films were employed as transparent anodes in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs). The cell performances of organic optoelectronic devices with the PSVA-treated PEDOT:PSS anodes were further improved due to the significant vertical phase separation and the self-organized PSS top surface in PSVA-treated PEDOT:PSS films, which can increase the anode conductivity and work function and allow the direct formation of a functional buffer layer between the active layer and the polymeric electrode. The results of the present study will allow better use and understanding of polymeric-blend materials and will further advance the realization of high-performance indium tin oxide (ITO)-free organic electronics.
