We fabricate a kind of flexible electrochromic (EC) film by spraying the mixed dispersion of silver nanowires (AgNWs) and poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) on the graphene (GR) electrode. AgNWs are embedded in the PEDOT nanoparticles, forming an interlaced conductive network and double electron transport channels; therefore, the disadvantages of poor conductive GR electrodes have been remedied effectively. The subsequent GR-based PEDOT/AgNWs composite films have revealed remarkable optical contrast (63%), high coloration efficiency (${182.8}\;{{\rm cm}^{2}}\;{{\rm C}^{ - 1}}$182.8cm2C-1), and good cycle stability (keeping the optical contrast about 60% after switching cycles of 16,000 s). In addition, the GR-based composite films can keep good EC performance after 2000 cycles of bending tests, while those of the ITO/PET-based composite films decrease dramatically. The ultraflexible GR-based PEDOT/AgNWs composite films with excellent EC properties present an opportunity for fabricating large-area flexible EC devices.
