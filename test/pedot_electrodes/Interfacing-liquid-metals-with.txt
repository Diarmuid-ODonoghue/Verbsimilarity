Highly stretchable conductors are essential components in deformable electronics. Owing to their high stretchability and conductivity, liquid metals have attracted significant attention for use as circuits and interconnections. However, their poor wettability to stretchable metal electrodes prevents the formation of stable electrical connections. This study examined two approaches for creating a stable interface between a liquid metal (EGaIn) and stretchable metal electrodes via: (i) the use of honeycomb-structured stretchable metal electrodes and (ii) the addition of a conducting polymer interlayer. The line width of the honeycomb had a significant influence on the formation of a stable interface. The liquid metal formed a stable film layer on honeycomb metal electrodes, which have line widths of less than 50 Î¼m. Coating
