Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are promising solar energy conversion devices with aesthetically favorable properties such as being colorful and having transparent features. They are also well-known for high and reliable performance even under ambient lighting, and these advantages distinguish DSCs for applications in window-type building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) that utilize photons from both lamplight and sunlight. Therefore, investigations on bifacial DSCs have been done intensively, but further enhancement in performance under back-illumination is essential for practical window-BIPV applications. In this research, highly efficient bifacial DSCs were prepared by a combination of electropolymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene) (PEDOT) counter electrodes (CEs) and cobalt bipyridine redox ([Co(bpy)3]3+/2+) electrolyte, both of which manifested superior transparency when compared with conventional Pt and iodide counterparts, respectively. Keen electrochemical analyses of PEDOT films verified that superior electrical properties were achievable when the thickness of the film was reduced, while their high electrocatalytic activities were unchanged. The combination of the PEDOT thin film and [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ electrolyte led to an unprecedented power conversion efficiency among bifacial DSCs under back-illumination, which was also over 85% of that obtained under front-illumination. Furthermore, the advantage of the electropolymerization process, which does not require an elevation of temperature, was demonstrated by flexible bifacial DSC applications.
