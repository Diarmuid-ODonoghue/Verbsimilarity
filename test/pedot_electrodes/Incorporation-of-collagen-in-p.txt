Electrochemical polymerization can be used to directly synthesize conducting polymers while incorporating different functional molecules such as proteins for specific applications. There is a need to systematically study the effects of synthetic conditions for a polymer/protein composite on its nanostructure, chem/physical properties, and bioactivities. In this study, collagen, a cell-adhesion protein, was impregnated in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) via galvanostatic electropolymerization, and demonstrated binding with the PEDOT backbone and excellent stability. The polymer polymerized at lower current densities shows good electroactivity. Oxidation level of PEDOT was investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The results show that simple inorganic anions are more readily to be doped into the polymer than the bulky collagen molecules. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation reveals that the PEDOT/collagen system has a surface morphology different from those previously studied, exhibiting a network structure with nano-silks interlacing. Optical microscopy examination shows that rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells are preferentially seeded on PEDOT/collagen other than PEDOT/LiClO(4), indicating that collagen is highly bioactive for cell adhesion. Further study shows that synthesis with a lower current density favors the incorporation of collagen and thus increases the cell attachment to the PEDOT/collagen matrix. This study renders a simple approach to tailor a bifunctional film with high bio- and electrochemical activity.
