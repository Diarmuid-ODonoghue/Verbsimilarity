Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-(PEDOT)-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with MnO2 nanoparticles (MnO2/PEDOT/rGO) was prepared using electrochemical methods. The MnO2/ PEDOT/rGO was obtained through the electrochemical reduction of PEDOT/GO and under electrochemical treatment in KMnO4. The PEDOT/rGO and MnO2/PEDOT/rGO were characterized by several instrumental and electrochemical methods. The electrocatalytic 02 reduction for both electrodes was investigated via cyclic and hydrodynamic voltammetry in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solutions. The kinetic analysis in comparison to PEDOT/rGO a significant enhancement was found for the MnO2/PEDOT/rGO. The proposed main path in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism on the MnO2/PEDOT/rGO was the direct four-electron transfer process with faster transfer kinetic rate. The better ORR kinetics were obtained due to the excellent composite formation and well attachment of MnO2 NPs within oxide form. The PEDOT/rGO was less stable for long term use than MnO2/PEDOT/rGO.
