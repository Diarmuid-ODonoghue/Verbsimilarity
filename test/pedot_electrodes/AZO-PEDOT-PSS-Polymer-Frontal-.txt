Thin-film hybrid organic-inorganic photovoltaic structures based on hydrogenated silicon (Si:H), poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) polymer Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films deposited on different types of flexible substrates have been fabricated and investigated. The compatibility of the polymer and inorganic materials regimes and deposition techniques used for device fabrication has been demonstrated on flexible substrates. Morphological characteristics of transparent Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films deposited on substrates have been measured by atomic force microscopy. Electronic characteristics of the fabricated photovoltaic structures have been measured and analyzed for different thicknesses of the transparent electrodes and different substrate types. Photovoltaic hybrid structure on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate showed the best characteristics: short circuit current density Jsc = 9.79 mA/cm², open circuit voltage Uoc = 565 mV, and PCE η = 1.3%. To analyze the mechanisms governing the device performance, short circuit current density spectral dependence of the devices fabricated on different types of flexible substrates has been measured. As demonstrated by our analysis, the structures on PEN substrates, besides better substrate transmittance, also show better junction properties.
