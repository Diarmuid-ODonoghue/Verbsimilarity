A novel fully organic bioelectronic device is presented and validated as electronic transducer and current stimulator for brain implants. The device integrates polymeric electrodes made of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) on paper thin foils, resulting in a high surface-to-volume ratio architecture that exhibits high sensitivity to interfacial ionic transport phenomena. The prototyping technique herein presented yields devices for the bidirectional communication with biological systems whose dimensionality can be controlled according to the desired application. Transduction of ultra-low local-field potentials and delivery of voltage pulse-trains alike those used in deep-brain stimulation are herein assessed, paving the way towards novel theranostic strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease and other severe neurodegenerative and/or traumatic pathologies of the central nervous system.
