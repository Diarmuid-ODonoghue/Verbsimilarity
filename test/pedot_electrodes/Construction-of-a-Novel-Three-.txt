This article discusses the deposition of different amount of microstuctured poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) on reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) by electrochemical method to prepare three-dimensional (3D) PEDOT/RVC electrodes aimed to be used in capacitive deionization (CDI) technology. A CDI unit cell has been constructed here in this study. The performance of CDI cell in the ion removal of NaCl onto the sites of PEDOT/RVC electrode has been systematically investigated in terms of flow-rate, applied electrical voltage, and increasing PEDOT loading on PEDOT/RVC electrodes. It is observed that the increase in flow-rate, electric voltage, and PEDOT loading up to a certain level improve the ion removal performance of electrode in the CDI cell. The result shows that these electrodes can be used effectively for desalination technology, as the electrosorption capacity/desalination performance of these electrodes is quite high compared to carbon materials. Moreover, the stability of the electrodes has been tested and it is reported that these electrodes are regenerative. The effect of increasing NaCl concentration on the electrosorption capacity has also been investigated for these electrodes. Finally, it has been shown that 1 mÂ³ PEDOT-120 min/RVC electrodes from 75 mg/L NaCl feed solution produce 421, 978 L water per day of 20 mg/L NaCl final concentration.
