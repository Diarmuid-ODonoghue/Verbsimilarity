This work describes a simple technique for direct patterning of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) composite electrodes in a large area on a substrate based on the solution transfer process by microcontact printing using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamps. Various shapes of SWNT/PEDOT-PSS composite patterns, such as line, circle, and square, can be easily fabricated with high pattern fidelity and structural integrity. The single parallel line pattern device exhibits high electrical conductivity (0.75 × 10(5) S/m) and electronic stability because of alignment of nanotubes and big-size SWNT bundles (∼5 nm). The electromechanical study reveals that the composite patterns show ∼1% resistance change along SWNT alignment direction and ∼5% resistance change along vertical alignment direction after 200 bend cycles. Our approach provides a facile, low-cost method to pattern transparent conductive SWNT/polymer composite electrodes and demonstrates a novel platform for future integration of conducting SWNT/polymer composite patterns for optoelectronic applications.
