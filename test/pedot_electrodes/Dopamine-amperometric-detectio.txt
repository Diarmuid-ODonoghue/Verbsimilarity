Chemically modified electrodes are widely employed in electroanalytical chemistry and an important goal is to strongly anchor redox mediators on the electrode surface. In this work, indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes have been coated with PEDOT:PSS that has been ferrocene-functionalized, by a two-step procedure consisting of the electrodeposition of PEDOT-N3 followed by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition of ethynylferrocene. The coated electrodes have been characterized by XPS, showing successful ferrocene immobilization, by AFM, and by cyclic voltammetry (CV), which is dominated by the stable and highly reversible response of ferrocene. The electrocatalytical performance of the device is assessed by analyzing 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethylamine, also commonly known as dopamine (DA). The sensor presents a linear range between 0.01 and 0.9 mM, a mean sensitivity of 196 mA M-1 cm-2 and a limit of detection (LoD) of 1 ÂµM.
