Flexible transparent electrodes are an indispensable component for flexible optoelectronic devices. In this work, the meter-scale composite transparent electrodes (CTEs) composed of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and Ag grid/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with optimized mechanical and optical properties are demonstrated by slot-die roll-to-roll technique with solution printing method under a low cost ($15-20 per square meter), via control of the viscosity and surface energy of PEDOT:PSS ink as well as the printing parameters. The CTEs show excellent flexibility remaining 98% of the pristine value after bending 2000 times under various bending situations, and the square resistance ( Rs) of CTEs can be reduced to 4.5-5.0 Î©/sq with an appropriate transmittance. Moreover, the optical performances, such as haze, extinction coefficient, and refractive index, are investigated, as compared with indium tin oxide/PET, which are potential for the inexpensive optoelectronic flexible devices. The CTEs could be successfully employed in polymer solar cells with different areas, showing a maximal power conversion efficiency of 8.08%.
