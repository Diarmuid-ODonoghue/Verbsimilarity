Conducting polymers have been widely explored as coating materials for metal electrodes to improve neural signal recording and stimulation because of their mixed electronic-ionic conduction and biocompatibility. In particular, the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is one of the best candidates for biomedical applications due to its high conductivity and good electrochemical stability. Coating metal electrodes with PEDOT has shown to enhance the electrode's performance by decreasing the impedance and increasing the charge storage capacity. However, PEDOT-coated metal electrodes often have issues with delamination and stability, resulting in decreased device performance and lifetime. In this work, we were able to electropolymerize PEDOT coatings on sharp platinum-iridium recording and stimulating neural electrodes and demonstrated its mechanical and electrochemical stability. Electropolymerization of PEDOT:tetrafluoroborate was carried out in three different solvents: propylene carbonate, acetonitrile, and water. The stability of the coatings was assessed via ultrasonication, phosphate buffer solution soaking test, autoclave sterilization, and electrical pulsing. Coatings prepared with propylene carbonate or acetonitrile possessed excellent electrochemical stability and survived autoclave sterilization, prolonged soaking, and electrical stimulation without major changes in electrochemical properties. Stimulating microelectrodes were implanted in rats and stimulated daily, for 7 and 15 days. The electrochemical properties monitored in vivo demonstrated that the stimulation procedure for both coated and uncoated electrodes decreased the impedance.
