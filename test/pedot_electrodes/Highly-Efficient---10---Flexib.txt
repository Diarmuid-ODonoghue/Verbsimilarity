A novel approach to fabricate flexible organic solar cells is proposed without indium tin oxide (ITO) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) using junction-free metal nanonetworks (NNs) as transparent electrodes. The metal NNs are monolithically etched using nanoscale shadow masks, and they exhibit excellent optoelectronic performance. Furthermore, the optoelectrical properties of the NNs can be controlled by both the initial metal layer thickness and NN density. Hence, with an extremely thin silver layer, the appropriate density control of the networks can lead to high transmittance and low sheet resistance. Such NNs can be utilized for thin-film devices without planarization by conductive materials such as PEDOT:PSS. A highly efficient flexible organic solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.6% and high device yield (93.8%) is fabricated on PEDOT-free and ITO-free transparent electrodes. Furthermore, the flexible solar cell retains 94.3% of the initial PCE even after 3000 bending stress tests (strain: 3.13%).
