Using polymeric ionic liquids and PEDOT as ion conducting separators and electrodes, respectively, an all-polymer-based organic electrochromic device (ECD) has been constructed. The advantages of such an ECD are: fast switching time (3 s), high coloration efficiency (390 cm(2) C(-1) at 620 nm), optical contrast up to Î”T = 22% and the possibility of working under vacuum.
