Contractile skeletal muscle cells were cultured so as to wrap around an electrode wire to enable their selective stimulation even when they were co-cultured with other electrically-excitable cells. Since the electrode wire was composed of the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polyurethane (PU), which is soft and highly capacitive (~10 mF cm-2), non-faradaic electrical stimulation with charge/discharge currents could be applied to the surrounding cells without causing significant damage even for longer periods (more than a week). The advantage of this new culture system was demonstrated in the study of chemotactic interaction of monocytes and skeletal muscle cells via myokines.
