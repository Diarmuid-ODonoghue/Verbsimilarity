Conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS, sandwiched between two conductive yarns, has been proven to have capacitive behavior in our textile energy storage devices. Full understanding of its underlying mechanism is still intriguing. The effect of the PEDOT to PSS ratio and the configuration of the electrode yarns are the focus of this study. Three commercial PEDOT:PSS yarns, Clevios P-VP-AI-4083, Ossila AI 4083, and Orgacon ICP 1050, as well as stainless steel and silver-coated polybenzoxazole (Ag/PBO) yarns, in various combinations, were used as solid electrolytes and electrodes, respectively. Analyses with NMR, ICP-OES, TGA, and resistivity measurement were employed to characterize the PEDOT:PSS. The device charge-discharge performance was measured by the Arduino microcontroller. Clevios and Ossila were found to have identical characteristics with a similar ratio, that is, 1:5.26, hence a higher resistivity of 1000 Ω.cm, while Orgacon had a lower PEDOT to PSS ratio, that is, 1:4.65, with a lower resistivity of 0.25⁻1 Ω.cm. The thermal stability of PEDOT:PSS up to 250 °C was proven. Devices with PEDOT:PSS having lower conductivity, such as Clevios P-VP-AI-4083 or Ossila AI 4083, showed capacitive behavior. For a better charge-discharge profile, it is also suggested that the PEDOT to electrode resistance should be low. These results led to a conclusion that a larger ratio of PEDOT to PSS, having higher resistivity, is more desirable, but further research is needed.
