We demonstrate an ionic polymer artificial mechanotransducer (i-PAM) capable of simultaneously yielding an efficient wide bandwidth and a blocking force to maximize human tactile recognition in soft tactile feedback. The unique methodology in the i-PAM relies on an ionic interpenetrating nanofibrillar network that is formed at the interface of (i) an ionic thermoplastic polyurethane nanofibrillar matrix with an ionic liquid of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM]+[TFSI]-) and (ii) ionic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) conducting polymer electrodes with dimethyl sulfoxide and [EMIM]+[TFSI]- as additives. The i-PAM-based actuator with the ionic PEDOT:PSS exhibits a stable operation up to 200 Hz at low voltage as well as a blocking force of 0.4 mN, which can be potentially adapted to soft tactile feedback. Furthermore, on the basis of this fast i-PAM, we realized alphabet tactile rendering by using a 3 Ã— 3 i-PAM array stimulated by a dc input of 2 V. We believe that our proposed approach can provide a rational guide to the human-machine soft haptic interface.
