Cross stacking of nanopatterned conductive polymer film was explored using a sacrificial soft template made of nanopatterned polystyrene (PS) film as a guide for nanopatterned conductive polymer film. For use as a conductive film, the PS pattern was filled with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and then completely removed, to generate single-patterned PEDOT (SPDOT) film having a conductivity of 1079 S/cm, which was comparable to the pristine unpatterned PEDOT (UPDOT) film on a glass slide. SPDOT layers were stacked across each other to form double-layered (DPDOT) and multiple-layered patterned PEDOT film on a glass slide or polymeric substrate. The patterned PEDOT film showed enhanced optical and electrochemical activity; specifically as compared to the UPDOT film on a glass slide, the DPDOT film showed an increase in reflectance and an enhanced electrochemically active surface by 23.4% and 32.8%, respectively. The patterned PEDOT film on a polymer substrate showed high bendability up to being completely folded and maintained its conductivity for over 10â€¯000 cycles of bending. The patterned PEDOT layers were applied to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO)-free counter electrode. An N719-based DSSC with a DPDOT film recorded a photoconversion efficiency of 7.54%, which is one of the highest values among the TCO-free DSSCs based on a PEDOT counter electrode.
