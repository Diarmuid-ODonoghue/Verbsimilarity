Silver ink is the most widely used conductive material for printing electrodes in the fabrication of all-printed ion gel gated transistors because of their high conductivity and low cost. However, electrochemical instability of printed silver electrodes is generally one of the biggest issues, whether it is in air where silver gets oxidized or in a moisture environment where electrochemical migration occurs. Notwithstanding, the electrochemical stability of printed silver electrodes in ion gel medium has not been studied so far. In this work, we studied the electrochemical instabilities of printed silver electrodes in fully printed ion gel gated single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin-film transistors (TFTs) and developed some strategies to overcome these issues. All-printed ion gel-based p-type SWCNT TFTs were employed to investigate the impact of electrochemical instabilities on the electrical behavior of printed SWCNT TFTs. The results have demonstrated that printed silver was unstable at anodic and cathodic polarization because of the corrosion by the ionic liquid. Besides, anodic corrosion of silver source/drain electrodes was shown to be responsible for the electrical failure of printed SWCNT TFTs in both the linear and saturated regime. These issues were completely resolved when preventing printed silver electrodes from coming into direct contact with ion gels. For example, ion gels were partially printed in device channels to avoid contacting the printed silver source and drain electrodes. At the same time, silver side-gate electrodes were replaced by inkjet-printed PEDOT:PSS electrodes to avoid gate electrode-related instabilities. Consequently, all-printed electrochemically stable SWCNT TFTs fabricated were obtained with enhanced performance of higher ION/IOFF ratios (105 to 106), smaller subthreshold slopes (∼70 mV/dec), and smaller hysteresis (ΔV = 0.025 V) at gate voltages from 1.2 to -0.5 V. Additionally, the polarity of all-printed SWCNT TFTs was converted from the p-channel to ambipolar while achieving lower leakage currents.
