Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have been investigated extensively for use in perovskite-based solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) because of their excellent electrical and optical properties. Although the flexibility of perovskite LEDs has been studied through empirical methods such as cyclic bending tests, the flexibility of the perovskite layer has not been investigated systemically. Here, flexible and semitransparent perovskite LEDs are fabricated: a PEDOT:PSS anode and Ag nanowire cathode allow for flexible and semitransparent devices, while the use of a conjugated polyelectrolyte as an interfacial layer reduces the electron injection barrier between the cathode and the electron transport layer (SPW-111), resulting in enhanced device efficiency. Cyclic bending tests performed on the electrodes and in situ hole-nanoindentation tests performed on the constituent materials suggest that mechanical failure occurs in the perovskite MAPbBr3 layer during cyclic bending, leading to a decrease in the luminance. Tensile properties of the MAPbBr3 layer explain the critical bending radius ( rb) of the perovskite LEDs on the order of 1 mm.
