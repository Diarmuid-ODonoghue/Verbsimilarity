Using cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscope (XSTM) with samples cleaved in situ in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, this study demonstrates the direct visualization of high-resolution interfacial band mapping images across the film thickness in an optimized bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell consisting of nanoscale phase segregated blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). We were able to achieve the direct observation of the interfacial band alignments at the donor (P3HT)-acceptor (PCBM) interfaces and at the interfaces between the photoactive P3HT:PCBM blends and the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) anode modification layer with an atomic-scale spatial resolution. The unique advantage of using XSTM to characterize polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells allows us to explore simultaneously the quantitative link between the vertical morphologies and their corresponding local electronic properties. This provides an atomic insight of interfacial band alignments between the two opposite electrodes, which will be crucial for improving the efficiencies of the charge generation, transport, and collection and the corresponding device performance of polymer solar cells.
