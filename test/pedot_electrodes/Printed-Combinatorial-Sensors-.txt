In this study, an effective and simple direct printing method was developed to create sensing devices on screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) to detect multiple species simultaneously. Two sensing materials, graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONRs) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), were printed on one SPCE for detection of multiple biochemical substances. Printed layers of the GONRs and PEDOT:PSS mixture (GONRs & PEDOT:PSS) on SPCE showed embedment of GONRs in the PEDOT:PSS layer and diminished the electrochemical activity of GONRs. In contrast, by printing the GONRs and PEDOT:PSS at separate locations (GONRs + PEDOT:PSS) on the same SPCE, the electrochemical activities of both GONRs and PEDOT:PSS can be preserved. Thus, without synthesizing new materials, the modified electrode is able to simultaneously detect ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), dopamine (DA), and nitrite (NO2-), with high anodic oxidation currents and well-separated voltammetric peaks, in differential pulse voltammetry measurements. The detection limits for the four analytes are 41 nM (AA), 30 nM (DA), 11 nM (UA), and 18 nM (NO2-), respectively. The electrode can either detect single species separately or simultaneously determine specific concentrations of the four species in aqueous mixtures, and this can be further extended for many other electrochemical sensing applications.
