Here we develop a novel fabrication approach for producing three-dimensional (3D) conducting polymer-based bioelectronic interfaces (BEIs) that can be integrated on electronic devices for rare circulating tumor cell (CTC) isolation, detection, and collection via an electrically triggered cell released from chips. Based on the chemical oxidative polymerization of carboxylic acid-modified 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and modified poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) transfer printing technology, the high-aspect-ratio structures of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-based "nanorod" arrays can be fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes when using the Si "microrod" arrays as masters. Furthermore, we integrated the biotinylated poly-(l)-lysine-graft-poly-ethylene-glycol (PLL-g-PEG-biotin) coating with 3D PEDOT-based BEIs for dynamic control of the capture/release performance of CTCs on chips; this combination exhibited an optimal cell-capture yield cells of ∼45 000 cells cm-2 from EpCAM-positive MCF7 while maintaining resistance from the adhesion of EpCAM-negative HeLa cells at a density of ∼4000 cells cm-2. By taking advantage of the electrochemical doping/dedoping properties of PEDOT materials, the captured CTCs can be triggered to be electrically released through the desorption phenomena of the PLL-g-PEG-biotin. More than 90% of the captured cells can be released while maintaining very high cell viability. Therefore, it is conceivable that the use of a 3D PEDOT-based BEI platform will meet the requirements for the development of downstream characterization of CTCs, as well as the next generation of bioelectronics for biomedical applications.
