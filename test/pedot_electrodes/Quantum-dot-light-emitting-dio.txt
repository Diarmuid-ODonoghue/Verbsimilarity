A study of hybrid ZnCdSeS/ZnS quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) device fabricated with indium tin oxide-free transparent electrodes is presented. Al-doped zinc oxide (AZO) prepared by magnetron sputtering is adopted in anode transparent electrodes for green QLEDs with different sputtering pressures. A Kelvin probe force microscopy measurement showed that AZO has a work function of approximately 5.0 eV. The AZO/poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene)/polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) interface can be adjusted by the sputtering pressures, which was confirmed by hole-only devices. AZO films with low surface roughness can form a good AZO/PEDOT:PSS interface, which can increase the holes' injection, and result in an improved charge balance. The maximum current efficiency, luminance, and external quantum efficiency of the optimized QLED devices under a sputtering pressure of 1 mTorr can achieve values of 50.75 cd A-1, 102 500 cd m-2, and 12.94%, respectively.
