Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are solar energy conversion devices with high efficiency and simple fabrication procedures. Developing transparent counter electrode (CE) materials for bifacial DSSCs can address the needs of window-type building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). Herein, transparent organic-inorganic hybrid composite films of molybdenum disulfide and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (MoS2/PEDOT) are prepared to take full advantage of the conductivity and electrocatalytic ability of the two components. MoS2 is synthesized by hydrothermal method and spin-coated to form the MoS2 layer, and then PEDOT films are electrochemically polymerized on top of the MoS2 film to form the composite CEs. The DSSC with the optimized MoS2/PEDOT composite CE shows power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7% under front illumination and 4.82% under back illumination. Compared with the DSSC made by the PEDOT CE and the Pt CE, the DSSC fabricated by the MoS2/PEDOT composite CE improves the PCE by 10.6% and 6.4% for front illumination, respectively. It proves that the transparent MoS2/PEDOT CE owes superior conductivity and catalytic properties, and it is an excellent candidate for bifacial DSSC in the application of BIPVs.
