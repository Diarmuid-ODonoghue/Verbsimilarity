The general clinical procedure for viral DNA detection or gene mutation diagnosis following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) often involves gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing, which is usually time-consuming. In this study, we have proposed a facile strategy to construct a DNA biosensor, in which the platinum electrode was modified with a dual-film of electrochemically synthesized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) resulting in immobilized gold nanoparticles, with the gold nanoparticles easily immobilized in a uniform distribution. The DNA probe labeled with a SH group was then assembled to the fabricated electrode and employed to capture the target DNA based on the complementary sequence. The hybridization efficiency was evaluated with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in the presence of daunorubicin hydrochloride. Our results demonstrated that the peak current in DPV exhibited a linear correlation the concentration of target DNA that was complementary to the probe DNA. Moreover, the electrode could be reused by heating denaturation and re-hybridization, which only brought slight signal decay. In addition, the addition of the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD‚Å∫) could dramatically enhance the sensitivity by more than 5.45-fold, and the limit-of-detection reached about 100 pM.
