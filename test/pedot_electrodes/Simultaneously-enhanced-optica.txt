We report on a new surface modifier which simultaneously improves electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of silver nanowire-based stretchable transparent electrodes. The transparent electrodes treated with 11-aminoundecanoic acid achieve a low sheet resistance of 26.0Â ohm/sq and a high transmittance of 90% with an excellent stretchability. These improvements are attributed to the effective formation of a strong chemical bond between silver nanowire networks and elastomeric substrates by 11-aminoundecanoic acid treatment. The resistance change of the optimized silver nanowire/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) thin-films is only about 10% when the film is stretched by 120%. In addition, the chemical stability of stretchable silver nanowire films is significantly improved by the introduction of conductive PEDOT:PSS overcoat film. The optimized electrodes are utilized as high-performance stretchable transparent heaters, successfully illustrating its feasibility for future wearable electronics.
