Topographical features are essential to neural interface for better neuron attachment and growth. This paper presents a facile and feasible route to fabricate an electroactive and biocompatible micro-patterned Single-walled carbon nanotube/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) composite films (SWNT/PEDOT) for interface of neural electrodes. The uniform SWNT/PEDOT composite films with nanoscale pores and microscale grooves significantly enlarged the electrode-electrolyte interface, facilitated ion transfer within the bulk film, and more importantly, provided topology cues for the proliferation and differentiation of neural cells. Electrochemical analyses indicated that the introduction of PEDOT greatly improved the stability of the SWNT/PEDOT composite film and decreased the electrode/electrolyte interfacial impedance. Further, in vitro culture of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and MTT testing showed that the grooved SWNT/PEDOT composite film was non-toxic and favorable to guide the growth and extension of neurite. Our results demonstrated that the fabricated microscale groove patterns were not only beneficial in the development of models for nervous system biology, but also in creating therapeutic approaches for nerve injuries.
