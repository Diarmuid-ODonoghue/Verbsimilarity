A novel solution fabrication of large-area, highly conductive graphene films by spray-coating of a hybrid ink of exfoliated graphene (EG)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (PH1000) is demonstrated. The fabricated graphene films exhibit excellent mechanical properties, thus enabling their application as bottom electrodes in ultrathin organic photodetector devices with performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art Si-based inorganic photodetectors.
