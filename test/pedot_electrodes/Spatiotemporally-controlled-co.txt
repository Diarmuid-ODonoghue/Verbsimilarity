We have developed gel sheet-supported C(2)C(12) myotube micropatterns and combined them with a microelectrode array chip to afford a skeletal muscle cell-based bioassay system. Myotube line patterns cultured on a glass substrate were transferred with 100% efficiency to the surface of fibrin gel sheets. The contractile behavior of each myotube line pattern on the gel was individually controlled by localized electrical stimulation using microelectrode arrays that had been previously modified with electropolymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). We successfully demonstrated fluorescent imaging of the contraction-induced translocation of the glucose transporter, GLUT4, from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane of the myotubes. This device is applicable for the bioassay of contraction-induced metabolic alterations in a skeletal muscle cell.
