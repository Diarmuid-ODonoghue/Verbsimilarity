Earth abundant silicon compounds, including Si3N4, SiO2, SiS2, and SiSe2, were introduced as the electrocatalytic materials for the counter electrodes (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Among these silicon-based materials, Si3N4, SiS2, and SiSe2 were applied in DSSCs for the first time. In the presence of a conducting binder, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (
