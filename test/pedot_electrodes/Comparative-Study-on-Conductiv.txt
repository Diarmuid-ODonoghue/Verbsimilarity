Long-term monitoring of the electrical activity of the heart helps to detect the presence of potential dysfunctions, enabling the diagnosis of a wide range of cardiac pathologies. However, standard electrodes used for electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition are not fully integrated into garments, and generally need to be used with a gel to improve contact resistance. This article is focused on the development of washable screen-printed cotton, with and without Lycra, textile electrodes providing a medical quality ECG signal to be used for long-term electrocardiography measurements. Several samples with different Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) concentrations were investigated. Silver-plated knitted fabric electrodes were also used for comparison, within the same process of ECG signal recording. The acquisition of ECG signals carried out by a portable medical device and a low-coast Arduino-based device on one female subject in a sitting position. Three textile electrodes were placed on the right and left forearms and a ground electrode was placed on the right ankle of a healthy female subject. Plastic clamps were applied to maintain electrodes on the skin. The results obtained with PEDOT:PSS used for electrodes fabrication have been presented, considering the optimal concentration required for medical ECG quality and capacity to sustain up to 50 washing cycles. All the ECG signals acquired and recorded, using PEDOT:PSS and silver-plated electrodes, have been reviewed by a cardiologist in order to validate their quality required for accurate diagnosis.
