Nanoclusters of Ir were electrochemically deposited on carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate modified with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), a conducting polymer between the potential range 0.0 V and 0.6 V at 0.05 V/s scan rate. The electrocatalytic activity of Ir-PEDOT/CFP electrode towards oxidation of morin, a flavonoid was significantly greater than that of PEDOT/CFP and bare CFP electrodes. Factors affecting the anodic peak of morin namely, effect of pH, scan rate and number of cycles were optimized. The electrochemical route involved adsorption controlled and irreversible processes. Under optimal conditions, the linear dynamic range for the determination of morin was found to be 0.12 nM-2.80 nM. The significantly low detection limit (42.18 pM) demonstrates the ultrasensitivity of the proposed method. The reliability of the method was evaluated for the quantification of morin present in mulberry leaves, guava leaves and grape wine.
