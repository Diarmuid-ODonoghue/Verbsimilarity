Solution-processed silver nanowire (AgNW) films have attracted attention as transparent and conductive electrodes for flexible optoelectronic devices and touch screens, to replace sputtered indium-tin-oxide (ITO) films. However, the mechanical flexibility, environmental durability, and the optical (such as transparency and a haze) and electrical properties of the AgNW films should be improved for their practical application. In this work, high-performance and roll-to-roll processed AgNW-based hybrid electrodes comprising poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (
