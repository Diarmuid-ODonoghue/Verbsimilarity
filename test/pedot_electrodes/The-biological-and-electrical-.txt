Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films have attracted substantial interest as coatings for platinum neuroprosthetic electrodes due to their excellent chemical stability and electrical properties. This study systematically examined PEDOT coatings formed with different amounts of charge and dopant ions, and investigated the combination of surface characteristics that were optimal for neural cell interactions. PEDOT samples were fabricated by varying the electrodeposition charge from 0.05 to 1 C cm(-2). Samples were doped with either poly(styrenesulfonate), tosylate (pTS) or perchlorate. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that both thickness and nodularity increased as the charge used to produce the sample was increased, and larger dopants produced smoother films across all thicknesses. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the amount of charge directly corresponded to the thickness and amount of dopant in the samples. Additionally, with increased thickness and nodularity, the electrochemical properties of all PEDOT coatings improved. However, neural cell adhesion and outgrowth assays revealed that there is a direct biological tradeoff related to the thickness and nodularity. Cell attachment, growth and differentiation was poorer on the thicker, rougher samples, but thin, less nodular PEDOT films exhibited significant improvements over bare platinum. PEDOT/pTS fabricated with a charge density of <0.1Ccm(-2) provided superior electrochemical and biological properties over conventional platinum electrodes and would be the most suitable conducting polymer for neural interface applications.
