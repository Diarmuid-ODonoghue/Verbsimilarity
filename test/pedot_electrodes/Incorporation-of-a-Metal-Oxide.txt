Transition metal oxide (TMO) thin films have been exploited as interlayers for charge extraction between electrodes and active layers in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Additionally, graphene-electrode-based OPVs have received considerable attention as a means to enhance device stability. However, the film deposition process of a TMO thin-film layer onto the graphene electrode is highly restricted owing to the hydrophobic nature of the graphene surface; thus, the preparation of the device should rely on a vacuum process that is incompatible with solution processing. In this study, we present a novel means for creating a thin tungsten oxide (WO3 ) interlayer on a graphene electrode by employing an engineered biotemplate of M13 viruses, whereby nondestructive functionalization of the graphene and uniform synthesis of a WO3 thin interlayer are concurrently achieved. As a result, the incorporated virus-templated WO3 interlayer exhibited solar-conversion efficiency that was 20â€‰% higher than that of conventional OPVs based on the use of a (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (
