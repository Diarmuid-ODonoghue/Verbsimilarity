New reliable and robust potentiometric ion-selective electrodes were fabricated using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) as the solid contact between the sensing membrane and electrical substrate for an acetylcholine (ACh) bioassay. A film of PEDOT/PSS was deposited on a solid carbon screen-printed platform made from ceramic substrate. The selective materials used in the ion-selective electrode (ISE) sensor membrane were acetylcholinium tetraphenylborate (ACh/TPB/PEDOT/PSS-ISE) (sensor I) and triacetyl-β-cyclodextrin (β-CD/PEDOT/PSS-ISE) (sensor II). The sensors revealed clear enhanced Nernstian response with a cationic slope 56.4 ± 0.6 and 55.3 ± 1.1 mV/decade toward (ACh+) ions over the dynamic linear range 1.0 × 10-6-1 × 10-3 and 2.0 × 10-6-1.0 × 10-3 M at pH 5 with limits of detection 2.0 × 10-7 and 3.2 × 10-7 M for sensors I and II, respectively. The selectivity behavior of both sensors was also tested and the sensors showed a significant high selectivity toward ACh+ over different common organic and inorganic cations. The stability of the potential response for the solid-contact (SC)/ISEs was evaluated using a chronopotentiometric method and compared with that of electrodes prepared without adding the solid-contact material (PEDOT/PSS). Enhanced accuracy, excellent repeatability, good reproducibility, potential stability, and high selectivity and sensitivity were introduced by these cost-effective sensors. The sensors were also used to measure the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). A linear plot between the initial rate of the hydrolysis of ACh+ substrate and enzyme activity held 5.0 × 10-3-5.2 IU∙L-1 of AChE enzyme. Application to acetylcholine determination in human serum was done and the results were compared with the standard colorimetric method.
