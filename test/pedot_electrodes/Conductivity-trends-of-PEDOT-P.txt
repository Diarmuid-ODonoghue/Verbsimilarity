A stretchable e-textile was fabricated by simply soaking Spandex fabric in a conductive polymer aqueous dispersion, PEDOT-PSS. The resulting conductive fabric had an average conductivity of 0.1 S/cm. Subjecting the fabric to more than one soaking step increased the conductivity of the fabric up to ca. 2.0 S/cm resulting in a 33% faster switching speed. This simple methodology is not limited to Spandex (50% nylon/50% polyurethane). Several other fabric compositions were investigated for their conductivity via this process, including 100% cotton, 60% cotton/40% polyester, 95% cotton/5% Lycra, 60%polyester/40% rayon, 100% polyester, and 80% nylon/20% Spandex, listed in order of decreasing hydrophilicity. Those fabrics with higher water uptake resulted in higher conductivities upon soaking in PEDOT-PSS. Electrochromic polymers coated on the fabric could be switched between their different colored states, even upon stretching of the Spandex. SEM revealed that the electrochromic polymer coated on the substrate separated under stretching, uncovering the color of the base conducting fabric. It was found that the PEDOT-PSS was not a film on the Spandex but rather homogenously dispersed nanoparticles within the fabric matrix forming a percolated network.
