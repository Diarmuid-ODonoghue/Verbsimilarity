Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophenes) (PEDOT) have been extensively explored as materials for biomedical implants such as biosensors, tissue engineering scaffolds and microelectronic devices. Considerable effort has been made to incorporate biologically active molecules into the conducting polymer films in order to improve their long term performance at the soft tissue interface of devices, and the development of functionalized conducting polymers that can be modified with biomolecules would offer important options for device improvement. Here we report surface modification, via straightforward protocols, of carboxylic-acid-functional PEDOT copolymer films with the nonapeptide, CDPGYIGSR, derived from the basement membrane protein laminin. Evaluation of the modified surfaces via XPS and toluidine blue O assay confirmed the presence of the peptide on the surface and electrochemical analysis demonstrated unaltered properties of the peptide-modified films. The efficacy of the peptide, along with the impact of a spacer molecule, for cell adhesion and differentiation was tested in cell culture assays employing the rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. Peptide-modified films comprising the longest poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer used in this study, a PEG with ten ethylene glycol repeats, demonstrated the best attachment and neurite outgrowth compared to films with peptides alone or those with a PEG spacer comprising three ethylene glycol units. The films with PEG10-CDPGYISGR covalently modified to the surface demonstrated 11.5% neurite expression with a mean neurite length of 90Î¼m. This peptide immobilization technique provides an effective approach to biofunctionalize conducting polymer films.
