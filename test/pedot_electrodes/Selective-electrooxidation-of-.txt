A novel amperometric sensor for the determination of uric acid was fabricated using room temperature ionic liquid and nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticle composite which was immobilized on paraffin wax impregnated graphite electrode. The nickel hexacyanoferrate nanoparticle was characterized by UV-vis, X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical behavior of the modified electrode was investigated in detail by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Various experimental parameters influencing the electrochemical behavior of the modified electrode were optimized by varying the supporting electrolyte, scan rate and pH. The apparent electron transfer rate constant (K(s)) and charge transfer coefficient (α) of the modified electrode were found to be 1.358(± 0.02)cm/s and 0.65, respectively from cyclic voltammetry. The sensor exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of uric acid. The interference from ascorbic acid was easily overcome by coating the modified electrode with PEDOT layer. Under optimal condition, the determination range for uric acid is from 1.0 × 10(-6)M to 2.6 × 10(-3)M and the detection limit was 3.3 × 10(-7)M (3σ). The proposed method has been used for the determination of uric acid in human urine samples.
