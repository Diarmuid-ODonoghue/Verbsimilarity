A conducting polymer-based composite material of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) doped with different percentages of a room temperature ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF₄]), was prepared and a very small amount of the composite (2.0 µL) was drop-coated on the working area of a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The SPCE, modified with PEDOT:PSS/IL composite thin-film, was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), profilometry and sessile contact angle measurements. The prepared PEDOT:PSS/IL composite thin-film exhibited a nano-porous microstructure and was found to be highly stable and conductive with enhanced electrocatalytic properties towards catechol, a priority pollutant. The linear working range for catechol was found to be 0.1 µM-330.0 µM with a sensitivity of 18.2 mA·mM·cm-2 and a calculated limit of detection (based on 3× the baseline noise) of 23.7 µM. When the PEDOT:PSS/IL/SPCE sensor was used in conjunction with amperometry in stirred solution for the analysis of natural water samples, the precision values obtained on spiked samples (20.0 µM catechol added) (n = 3) were 0.18% and 0.32%, respectively, with recovery values that were well over 99.0%.
