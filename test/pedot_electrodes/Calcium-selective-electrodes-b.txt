We report here the fabrication of solid-contact calcium-selective electrodes (Ca2+-SCISEs) made of a polyurethane acrylate ion-selective membrane (ISM) that was covalently attached to the underlying ion-to-electron transducer (solid-contact). Methacrylate-functionalized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (Meth-PEDOT) and Meth-PEDOT films containing either multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) or carboxylated MWCNT (cMWCNT) were used as solid contacts. The solid contacts were deposited by drop-casting on screen-printed electrodes and characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiometry. Covalent binding between the solid contact and the ISM was obtained via photopolymerization in order to increase the robustness of the Ca2+-SCISEs. The performance of the Ca2+-SCISEs was studied by measuring their potentiometric response and their sensitivity to light, oxygen and carbon dioxide. Meth-PEDOT was found to be a promising solid-contact material to develop low-cost and easy to prepare ISEs.
