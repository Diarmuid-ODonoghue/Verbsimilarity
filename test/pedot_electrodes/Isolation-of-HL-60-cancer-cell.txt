Herein, aptamer-modified self-propelled nanomotors were used for transportation of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) from a human serum sample. For this purpose, the fabricated manganese oxide nanosheets-polyethyleneimine decorated with nickel/gold nanoparticles (MnO2-PEI/Ni/Au) as nanomotors were added to a vial containing thiolated aptamer KH1C12 solution as a capture aptamer to attach to the gold nanoparticles on the surface of nanomotors covalently. The aptamer-modified self-propelled nanomotors (aptamerKH1C12/nanomotors) were then separated by placing the vial in a magnetic stand. The aptamer-modified self-propelled nanomotors were rinsed three times with water to remove the non-attached aptamers. Then, the resulting aptamerKH1C12/nanomotors were applied for the on-the-fly" transporting of HL-60 cancer cell from a human serum sample. To release of the captured HL-60 cancer cells, the complementary nucleotide sequences of KH1C12 aptamer solution (releasing aptamer) that has a with capture aptamer was added to phosphate buffer solution (1 M, pH 7.4) containing HL-60/aptamerKH1C12/nanomotors. Because of the high affinity of capture aptamer to complementary nucleotide sequences of aptamerKH1C12, the HL-60 cancer cells released on the surface of aptamerKH1C12/nanomotors into the solution. The second goal of the present work was determining the concentration of HL-60 cancer cell in the human serum samples. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique (EIS) was used for the determination of HL-60 cancer cell. The concentration of separated cancer cell was determined by aptamer/gold nanoparticles-poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) modified GC electrode (GC/PEDOT-Aunano/aptamer KH1C12). The proposed aptasensor exhibited a good response to the concentration of HL-60 cancer cells in the range of 2.5 × 101 to 5 × 105 cells mL-1 with a low limit of detection of 250 cells mL-1.
