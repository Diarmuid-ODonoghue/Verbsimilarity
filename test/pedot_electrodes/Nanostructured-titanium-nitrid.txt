The composite films of titanium nitride in conjunction with polystyrenesulfonate-doped poly (3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) were prepared by a simple mechanical mixture of TiN and PEDOT:PSS under ultrasonication, which was demonstrated to deliver an effectively combined network of both high electrical conductivity and superior electrocatalytic activity. The composite films have been explored as an alternative for the counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells. It was manifested that these nanostructured TiN-PEDOT:PSS composite films displayed excellent performance comparable to Pt-FTO counter electrode due to the combined network endowing more favorable and efficient interfacial active sites. Among them, the energy conversion efficiency of the cell with TiN(P)-PEDOT:PSS as counter electrode reached 7.06%, which was superior to 6.57% of the cell with Pt-FTO counter electrode under the same experimental conditions.
