We study the top surface composition of blends of the conjugated polymer regioregular poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) with the fullerene (6,6)-phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), an important model system for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), using near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS). We compare the ratio of P3HT to PCBM near the air/film interface that results from preparing blend films on two sets of substrates: (1) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) coated indium tin oxide (ITO) as is commonly used in conventional OPV structures and (2) ZnO substrates that are either unmodified or modified with a C(60)-like self-assembled monolayer, similar to those that have been recently reported in inverted OPV structures. We find that the top surface (the film/air interface) is enriched in P3HT compared to the bulk, regardless of substrate or annealing conditions, indicating that changes in device performance due to substrate modification treatments should be attributed to the buried substrate/film interface and the bulk of the film rather than the exposed film/air interface.
