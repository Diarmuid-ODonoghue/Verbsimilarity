Conducting polymers are soft, flexible materials, exhibiting material properties that can be reversibly changed by electrochemically altering the redox state. Surface chemistry is an important determinant for the molecular events of cell adhesion. Therefore, we analyzed whether the redox state of the conducting polymer PEDOT:Tosylate can be used to control epithelial cell adhesion and proliferation. A functionalized cell culture dish comprising two adjacent electrode surfaces was developed. Upon electronic addressing, reduced and oxidized surfaces are created within the same device. Simultaneous analysis of how a homogenous epithelial MDCK cell population responded to the electrodes revealed distinct surface-specific differences. Presentation of functional fibronectin on the reduced electrode promoted focal adhesion formation, involving alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, cell proliferation, and ensuing formation of polarized monolayers. In contrast, the oxidized surface harbored only few cells with deranged morphology showing no indication of proliferation. This stems from the altered fibronectin conformation, induced by the different surface chemistry of the PEDOT:Tosylate electrode in the oxidized state. Our results demonstrate a novel use of PEDOT:Tosylate as a cell-hosting material in multiple-electrode systems, where cell adhesion and proliferation can be controlled by electrochemical modulation of surface properties.
