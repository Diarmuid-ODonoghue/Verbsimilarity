Flexible quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (FQLEDs) hold great promise as a leading display and lighting technology due to their light weight, low-cost, and saturated emission color. However, there remain many challenges in the development of high quality electrodes on flexible substrates for device fabrication and operation. In this work, we present a robust flexible transparent conductive film with embedded random Ag networks in the PET substrate (named PRAN). The PRAN composite film exhibits an average transmittance of 85%, and the sheet resistance reaches near 5.3 Î© sq-1 without any obvious change after bending 3000 times, indicating excellent flexibility of this type of conductive film. A highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer was employed to smooth the surface of the PRAN electrode. Consequently, FQLEDs based on these flexible electrodes are successfully fabricated and the peak power efficiencies of 42.3, 101.9, and 6.4 lm W-1 are achieved for the red, green and blue devices, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best efficiencies for the FQLEDs reported to date. These results lay the foundation of the realization of ITO-free, high-efficiency FQLEDs for use in flexible lighting and display applications.
