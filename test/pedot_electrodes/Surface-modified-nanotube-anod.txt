In this work, we reported high performance OLED devices with transparent and conductive carbon nanotube anodes after modification. The modifications include IMRE proprietary PEDOT:PSS composite top coating (PS(C)), concentrated HNO(3) acid soaking, and polymer encapsulation. For PS(C)-modified nanotube thin film anode, we achieved maximum luminescence of approximately 9000 cd/m(2), close to ITO-based OLED device performance, and high efficiency of approximately 10 cd/A, similar with ITO-based OLED device. The performance is approximately 30 to 450 times better than that achieved for OLED devices using CNT anodes by others. In addition, we also investigate the mechanical property, work function, sheet resistance, and surface morphology of modified carbon nanotube thin-film anodes.
