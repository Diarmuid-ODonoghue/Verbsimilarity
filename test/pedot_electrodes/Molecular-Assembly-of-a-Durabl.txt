In this study, we provided the detailed characterizations of our recent HRP-AuNPs/PEDOT:BSA/Pt biosensor, constructed through a simple fabrication procedure with improved stability and good sensitivity. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy not only confirmed the synthesis of conductive PEDOT where BSA was the template for the polymerization, but also provided further insights into the stable immobilization of AuNP on the PEDOT:BSA film. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the attachment of AuNPs were stable under a high salt environment. The current technology demonstrates a feasible procedure to form a functional AuNPs/PEDOT:BSA film that has potential applications in the fabrication of various biosensors and electric devices.
