This article describes the preparation and characterization of PEDOT-coated paper electrodes. Their specific behavior was investigated, especially the impact of electrode shape on the electrochemical properties. It was found that different electrode geometries promote different results, largely because of a potential drop in the bulk of the electrode material. More importantly, the suitability of these substrates for bio- and neurochemical analyses was investigated. The paper electrodes were found to offer better resistance to both protein and neurotransmitter foulings, in comparison to a planar electrode. Interestingly, long paper electrodes were more stable during sustained oxidation of dopamine and serotonin than short ones, possibly because of the conjunction of surface passivation and potential drop allowing for the site of oxidation to move along the electrode as fouling progresses.
