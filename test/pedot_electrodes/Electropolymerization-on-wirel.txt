Conducting polymers can be easily obtained by electrochemical oxidation of aromatic monomers on an electrode surface as a film state. To prepare conducting polymer fibres by electropolymerization, templates such as porous membranes are necessary in the conventional methods. Here we report the electropolymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and its derivatives by alternating current (AC)-bipolar electrolysis. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) derivatives were found to propagate as a fibre form from the ends of Au wires used as bipolar electrodes (BPEs) parallel to an external electric field, without the use of templates. The effects of applied frequency and of the solvent on the morphology, growth rate and degree of branching of these PEDOT fibres were investigated. In addition, a chain-growth model for the formation of conductive material networks was also demonstrated.
