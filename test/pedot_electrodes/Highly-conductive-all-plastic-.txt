A novel transfer-printing method for high-performance all-plastic transparent electrodes is demonstrated. A solution process using H2 SO4 not only dramatically enhances the electrical conductivity of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) over 4000 S cm(-1) but also chemically modifies its adhesion properties, thereby enabling expeditious "pick-and-place" transfer onto arbitrary surfaces using elastomeric stamps. Flexible and transparent optoelectronic devices with transferred PEDOT:PSS electrodes show superb performances.
