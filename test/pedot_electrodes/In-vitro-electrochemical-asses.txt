Biobotics investigates the use of live insects as biological robots whose locomotion can be controlled by neurostimulation through implanted electrodes. Inactivity in the biobots (biological robots) can sometimes be noticed following extended neurostimulation, partly owing to incompatibility of implanted electrodes with the biobotic application or gradual degradation of the tissue-electrode interface. Implanted electrodes need to sufficiently exhibit consistent, reliable, and stable performance during stimulation experiments, have low tissue-electrode impedance, facilitate good charge injection capacity, and be compact in size or shape. Towards the goal of finding such electrodes suitable for biobotic applications, we compare electrochemical performances of five different types of electrodes in vitro with a saline based electrolytic medium. These include stainless steel wire electrodes, microfabricated flexible gold electrodes coated with PEDOT:PSS conductive polymer, eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) in a tube, and "hybrid" stainless steel electrodes coated with EGaIn. We also performed accelerated aging of the electrodes to help estimate their longitudinal performance. Based on our experimentation, microfabricated electrodes with PEDOT:PSS and stainless steel electrodes coated with EGaIn performed remarkably well. This is the first time conductive polymer and liquid metal electrodes were studied comparatively for neurostimulation applications. These in vitro comparison results will be used in the future to provide a benchmark for subsequent in vivo tests with implanted electrodes in cockroach biobots.
