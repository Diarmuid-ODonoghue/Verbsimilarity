In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of TCO-free, fully sprayed organic photodiodes on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. Transparent conducting films of single-wall carbon nanotubes are spray deposited from aqueous solutions. Low roughness is achieved, and films with sheet resistance values of 160 Î©/sq at 84% in transmittance are fabricated. Process issues related to the wetting of CNTs are then examined and solved, enabling successive spray depositions of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer and a blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The active layer is then optimized, achieving a process yield above 90% and dark currents as low as 10(-4) mA/cm(2). An external quantum efficiency of 65% and high reproducibility in the performance of the devices are obtained. Finally, the impact of the characteristics of the transparent electrode (transmittance and sheet resistance) on the performances of the device are investigated and validated through a theoretical model and experimental data.
