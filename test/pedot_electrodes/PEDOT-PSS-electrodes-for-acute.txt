The vagus nerve (VN) is involved in the autonomic regulation of many physiological systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, etc.) and its stimulation is already an approved therapy for refractory epilepsy and depression. Other pathologies are thought to be treatable through vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, inflammation or auto-immune diseases. However, the efficacy of the stimulation is not always optimal, partly due to the materials and the architecture of currently available electrodes. Standard electrodes, composed of metallic rings that stimulate the whole diameter of the nerve, are not adapted to experimentations involving spatial selectivity. Efficient and selective charge injection is usually difficult to achieve simultaneously, especially in experimental setups using rodents, due to the thin diameter of their VN. In this paper, we show that we can take advantage of the high charge injection property of conducting polymers to acutely stimulate the vagus nerve in rodents, using individual active electrodes with dimensions $725\,\,\mu \mathrm{m}\times \,450\,\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. A particular PEDOT:PSS architecture integrating 12 active electrodes is developed and applied to the VN of one rat. A closed-loop VNS system developed in our previous works is used to stimulate the VN while analyzing the heart rate response. Results show the feasibility of this kind of electrodes for acute VNS on rodents and open the path towards new experimentations focused on selective stimulation and recording.
