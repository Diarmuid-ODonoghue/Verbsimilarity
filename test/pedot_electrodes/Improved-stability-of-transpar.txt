A hybrid electrode, PEDOT:PSS/Ag NW containing a non-ionic surfactant (Triton X-100), was developed to enhance the mechanical stability of the Ag NW electrode and used for flexible ECL displays. The resulting hybrid electrode exhibited an outstanding figure of merit value of 12.3 × 10-3 Ω-1 and stable luminescence efficiency under the bending test.
