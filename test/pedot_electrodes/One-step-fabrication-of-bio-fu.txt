We report a simple, one-step synthesis of hybrid film by electropolymerizing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) on nanoporous gold (NPG) for applications in amperometric glucose biosensors. The enzyme, glucose oxidase (GOx), is entrapped into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) matrix, simultaneously. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies show the NPG preserve its original bicontinuous nanoporous structure and the PEDOT film grows uniformly with a thickness of ~10 nm. The modified electrodes have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and single potential step chronoamperometry (SPSC). The influence of PEDOT film's thickness has been explored to optimize sensor behaviors. Mediated by p-benzoquinone (BQ), the calibration curves have been obtained by applying relatively low constant potential of 200 mV (vs. SCE). The NPG/PEDOT/GOx (2CVs) biosensor exhibits high sensitivity of 7.3 Î¼A mM(-1) cm(-2) and a wide linear range of 0.1-15 mM, making it suitable for reliable analytic applications.
