This paper reports the synthesis and dopant dependent electrical and sensing properties of single poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanowire sensors. Dopant type (i.e. polystyrenesulfonate (PSS(-)) and perchlorate (ClO(4)(-))) and solvent (i.e. acetonitrile and 1 : 1 water-acetonitrile mixture) were adjusted to change the conjugation length and hydrophilicity of nanowires which resulted in change of the electrical properties and sensing performance. Temperature dependent coefficient of resistance (TCR) indicated that the electrical properties are greatly dependent on dopants and electrolyte where greater disorder was found in PSS(-) doped PEDOT nanowires compared to ClO(4)(-) doped nanowires. Upon exposure to different analytes including water vapor and volatile organic compounds, these nanowire devices displayed substantially different sensing characteristics. ClO(4)(-) doped PEDOT nanowires from an acetonitrile bath show superior sensing responses toward less electronegative analytes and followed a power law dependence on the analyte concentration at high partial pressures. These tunable sensing properties were attributed to variation in the conjugation lengths, dopant type and concentration of the wires which may be attributed to two distinct sensing mechanisms: swelling within the bulk of the nanowire and work function modulation of Schottky barrier junction between nanowire and electrodes.
