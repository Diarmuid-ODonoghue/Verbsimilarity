Microelectrodes have been widely used to detect and modulate the activities of neuronal networks. Various materials have been applied to microelectrode fabrication, and the conductive polymer is one of the most intensively explored material. The properties of conductive polymer highly depend on the incorporated material, so selecting it is essential. The mussel-inspired biomolecule, polydopamine (pDA), is known to provide unique chemical and mechanical properties to biological interfaces. NEW METHOD: pDA was incorporated into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) resulting in polydopamine PEDOT hybrid (PEDOT/pDA) microelectrode by an electrochemical deposition method. The electrical properties, such as impedance, charge storage capacity (CSC), and charge injection limit (CIL), of PEDOT/pDA microelectrodes, were characterized.
