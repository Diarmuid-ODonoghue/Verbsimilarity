Top emission organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as top electrodes were fabricated and characterized. Devices were fabricated on glass substrates with evaporated bottom Al/LiF cathodes, a spin coated organic emissive layer and a PEDOT-PSS hole injection layer. Transparent thin CNT films were deposited on top of the emission layer to form the anode by micro-contact printing with a polydimethylsiloxane stamp. A very good device performance was obtained, with a peak luminance of 3588 cd m(-2) and a maximum current efficiency of 1.24 cd A(-1). This work shows the possibility of using CNTs as transparent electrodes to replace ITO in organic semiconductor devices. Furthermore, the top emission nature of such devices offers a broader range of applications of CNTs on any type of substrate. By combining with solution processed organic materials, it is anticipated that lower cost fabrication will be possible through roll-to-roll manufacture.
