Two sensors for paracetamol were obtained on the basis of a GC electrode modified with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The first sensor was a GC electrode modified with a conductive composite layer of PEDOT doped with poly(4-lithium styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSLi), and the second one was a GC electrode modified by a composite of PEDOT doped with PSSLi and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). A conductive PEDOT polymer film was used as an electron mediator with a rich electron cloud. Both sensors were developed for the determination of paracetamol (ACOP) in the presence of interference compounds. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and adsorptive stripping differential pulse voltammetry (AdsDPV) were applied as analytical methods. The modified electrodes were successfully employed for the determination of ACOP in a pharmaceutical formulation.
