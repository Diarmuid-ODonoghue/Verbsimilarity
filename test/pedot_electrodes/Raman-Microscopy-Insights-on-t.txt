In the present report, we focused on the study of the out-of-plane electrical transport of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) composites (PEDOT:PSS-MWCNTs) as electrodes for solar cell applications. The out-of-plane direct current and alternating current electrical transport, rarely studied but not less relevant, was additionally supported with in-plane and out-of-plane confocal Raman microscopy and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering characterizations. The main relevance of our study is the monitoring of the polymer structure all across the polymeric film by using confocal Raman spectroscopy and its correlation with electrical transport. Modifications in the PEDOT benzenoid and quinoid conformations were observed in the vicinities of MWCNTs, and the enrichment of PSS at the indium tin oxide electrode interface was also evidenced. In consequence, the low MWCNT loadings into PEDOT:PSS lead to an increase of the out-of-plane conductivity, but the heavier MWCNT loadings lead to a drastic decrease. The tuning of the doping level of these polymer composites and the understanding of the interface structure are crucial to fabricate electrodes with higher out-of-plane conductivities for organic solar cell applications.
