Peroxynitrite is a potent nitroxidation agent and highly reactive metabolite, clinically correlated with a rich pathophysiology. Its sensitive and selective detection is challenging due to its high reactivity and short sub-second lifetime. Boron-doped diamond (BDD) microelectrodes have attracted interest because of their outstanding electroanalytical properties that include a wide working potential window and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Herein, we report on the modification of a BDD microelectrode with an electro-polymerized film of hemin and polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) for the purpose of selectively quantifying peroxynitrite. The nanostructured modified polymer layer was characterized by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical response to peroxynitrite was studied by voltammetry and time-based amperometry. The measured detection limit was 10 ± 0.5 nM (S/N = 3), the sensitivity was 4.5 ± 0.5 nA nM(-1) and the response time was 3.5 ± 1 s. The hemin-PEDOT BDD sensors exhibited a response variability of 5% or less (RSD). The stability of the sensors after a 20-day storage in 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4) at 4 °C was excellent as at least 93% of the initial response to 50 nM PON was maintained. The presence of PEDOT was correlated with a sensitivity increase.
