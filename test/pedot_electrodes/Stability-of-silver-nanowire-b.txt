Flexible transparent electrodes fabricated with random networks of silver nanowires (AgNWs) have been widely studied in recent years. This approach appears to be a promising alternative to replace ITO (indium tin oxide) in many optoelectronic applications. Many successful integrations in functional devices have already evidenced the high potential of this technology, but unfortunately only very few studies have been dedicated so far to the stability of this material. We present here a study dealing with the alteration of the electrical properties of AgNW meshes when subjected to different stresses. We demonstrate that AgNW electrodes are very stable when stored under ambient atmosphere up to, at least, two and a half years. Accelerated ageing processes also reveal that concentrated H2S or exposure to light does not cause any significant sheet resistance modification. However, the combination of high relative humidity and high temperature seems to be more critical. In addition, long lasting contact (two years) with PEDOT:PSS can induce deterioration of the electrical properties. Similarly, AgNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid materials exhibit weaker stability under electrical stress when compared to pristine AgNW networks.
