A highly conductive textile was woven from nano-fibers coated with the PEDOT-PSS polymer. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of textile electrodes for ECG recording as a smart garment. Electrode textile pads and lead wires were sewn to the lining of sportswear and their tolerability to repeated washings were tested up to 150 times. The electrical conductivity of the textile electrode remained functional for up to 50 machine washes. To assess the level of motion artifacts or noise during the daily monitoring of ECG, a single lead ECG with conventional or textile electrodes was recorded during supine rest, seated rest, upright trunk rotation (i.e., twisting), and stepping movement in 66 healthy adults. A Holter system was used for data storage and analysis. ECG patterns of P, QRS, and T waves were comparable between the conventional and textile electrodes. However, the signal-to-artifact-and/or-noise ratio (SAR) during twisting was larger in the textile electrodes than in the conventional electrodes. No skin irritation was seen in the textile electrodes. The single lead textile electrodes embedded in an inner garment were usable for continuous and/or repeated ECG monitoring in daily life except during vigorous trunk movement.
