Slurry based electrodes have shown promise as an energy dense and scalable storage technology for electrochemical flow batteries. Key to their efficient operation is the use of a conductive additive which allows for volumetric charging and discharging of the electrochemically active species contained within the electrodes. Carbon black is commonly used for this purpose due to the relatively low concentrations needed to maintain electrical percolation. While carbon black supplies the desirable electrical properties for the application, it contributes detrimentally to the rheology characteristics of these concentrated suspensions. In this work, we develop a synthesis protocol to produce inorganic oxide particles with electrostatically adsorbed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxithiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (
