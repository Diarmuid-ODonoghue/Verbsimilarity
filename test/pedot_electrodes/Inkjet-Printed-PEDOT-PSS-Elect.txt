Inkjet-printed PEDOT:PSS electrodes are shown to record cutaneous electrophysiological signals such as electrocardiograms via a simple finger-to-electrode contact. The recordings are of high quality and show no deterioration over a 3 month period, paving the way for the development of the next generation of low-cost, convenient-to-use healthcare monitoring devices.
