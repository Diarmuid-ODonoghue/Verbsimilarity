Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) has a variety of chemical and biomedical applications. The application of PEDOT/PSS polymers in drug delivery has attracted attention. However, whether conducting polymers of PEDOT/PSS could be used for dopamine delivery has not clear. In the present study, the PEDOT/PSS coatings incorporated with dopamine were fabricated on 0.5 mm diameter platinum electrodes, electrochemical properties, and dopamine delivery capacities of these electrodes were evaluated in vitro and in vivo through implanting these electrodes into brain striatum area. The findings demonstrated that the PEDOT/PSS/dopamine coatings on platinum electrodes could reduce electrodes impedances, increase charge storage capacities, and release significant levels of dopamine upon electrical stimulation of these electrodes. These results indicated that polymers of PEDOT/PSS/dopamine could be used for dopamine delivery, implicating potential application of PEDOT/PSS/dopamine-coated implantable electrodes in the treatment of some diseases associated with dopamine deficits, such as, electrodes for the treatment of Parkinson's disease during deep brain stimulation.
