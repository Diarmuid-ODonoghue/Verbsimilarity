Single transducer with humidity sensing materials has limitations in both range and sensitivity, which cannot be used to detect the full range of humidity with consistent sensitivity. To enlarge range and improve sensitivity in the all range relative humidity (RH), we propose a highly sensitive and full range detectable humidity sensor based on multiple inter-digital transducer (IDT) electrodes connected in series with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped poly (styrene sulfonate) anions (PEDOT: PSS), C15H15N3O2 (Methyl Red), and graphene oxide (GO) thin films as the active sensing materials. The humidity sensor with single active material has a limit in the detecting ranges, where the GO, PEDOT: PSS, and Methyl Red materials have sensing responses of 0 to 78% RH, 30 to 75% RH, and 25 to 100% RH, respectively. However, a humidity sensor using combined three active materials can respond to much wider range of RH with high sensitivity, where the IDTs and the active regions were prepared using ink-jet printing and spin coating, respectively. This proposed sensor can detect a full range of 0% RH to 100% RH. The response and recovery times are 1 sec and 3.5 sec, respectively. Our single sensing device using multiple IDTs connected different active materials in series can overcome the limitations of single transducer based sensor for the high performance sensor applications.
