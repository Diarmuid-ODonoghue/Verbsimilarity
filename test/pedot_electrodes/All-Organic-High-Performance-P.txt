Rapid development of wearable electronics, piezoelectric nanogenerator (PNG), has been paid a special attention because of its sustainable and accessible energy generation. In this context, we present a simple yet highly efficient design strategy to enhance the output performance of an all-organic PNG (OPNG) based on multilayer assembled electrospun poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofiber (NF) mats where vapor-phase polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-coated PVDF NFs are assembled as electrodes and neat PVDF NFs are utilized as an active component. In addition to the multilayer assembly, electrode compatibility and durability remain a challenging task to mitigate the primary requirements of wearable electronics. A multilayer networked three-dimensional structure integrated with a compatible electrode thereby provides enhanced output voltage and current (e.g., open-circuit voltage, Voc ≈ 48 V, and short-circuit current, Isc ≈ 6 μA, upon 8.3 kPa of the applied stress amplitude) with superior piezoelectric energy conversion efficiency of 66% compared to the single-mat device. Besides, OPNG also shows ultrasensitivity toward human movements such as foot strikes and walking. The weight measurement mapping is critically explored by principal component analysis that may have enormous applications in medical diagnosis to smart packaging industries. More importantly, fatigue test under continuous mechanical impact (over 6 months) shows great promise as a robust wearable mechanical energy harvester.
