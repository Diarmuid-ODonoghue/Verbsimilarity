A solution-processed vanadium oxide (s-VO(x)) anode buffer layer on an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrode was used instead of PEDOT:PSS for improving the stability and photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells (PSCs). The s-VO(x) layer was prepared by spin-coating a vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)(2)) isopropyl alcohol solution on the ITO electrode and then thermal annealing at 150 Â°C for 10 min. The s-VO(x) oxide layer is highly transparent in the visible range and shows effective hole collection property. The photovoltaic performance of the s-VO(x) buffer layer was studied by fabricating the PSCs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron donor and four soluble fullerene derivatives, [6,6]-phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC(60)BM), [6,6]-phenyl-C(71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC(70)BM), indene-C(60) bisadduct (IC(60)BA), and indene-C(70) bisadduct (IC(70)BA), as electron acceptors. The PSCs with the s-VO(x) buffer layer show improved performance in comparison with the traditional devices with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer on ITO, no matter which fullerene derivative was used as an acceptor. The power conversion efficiency of the PSC based on P3HT:IC(70)BA (1 : 1, w/w) with the s-VO(x) anode buffer layer reached 6.35% under the illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm(-2).
