A major challenge in systems-level neuroscience is to understand the dynamic formation and succession of brain states. A new study has extracted reproducible brain states from mouse resting-state fMRI data, revealing interactions between occurrences of these states and the phase of global signal fluctuations and alterations of the states in a mouse model of autism.
