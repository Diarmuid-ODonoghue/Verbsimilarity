Photovoltaic retinal prostheses theoretically offer the possibility of stand-alone high-resolution electrical stimulation of the retina. However, achieving focused epiretinal stimulation is particularly challenging because of axonal activation and electrical cell coupling. Recent evidence shows that long electric pulses permit a more focal activation of retinal ganglion cells, and non-rectangular waveforms induce higher network-mediated indirect activity.
