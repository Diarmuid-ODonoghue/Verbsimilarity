A new age of neuromodulation is emerging: one of restorative neuroengineering and neuroprosthetics. As novel device systems move toward regulatory evaluation and clinical trials, a critical need arises for evidence-based identification of potential sources of hardware-related complications to assist in clinical trial design and mitigation of potential risk.
