Regarding to the channel selection problem during the classification of electroencephalogram(EEG)signals,we proposed a novel method,Relief-SBS,in this paper.Firstly,the proposed method performed EEG channel selection by combining the principles of Relief and sequential backward selection(SBS)algorithms.And then correlation coefficient was used for classification of EEG signals.The selected channels that achieved optimal classification accuracy were considered as optimal channels.The data recorded from motor imagery task experiments were analyzed,and the results showed that the channels selected with our proposed method achieved excellent classification accuracy,and also outperformed other feature selection methods.In addition,the distribution of the optimal channels was proved to be consistent with the neurophysiological knowledge.This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.It can be well concluded that our proposed method,Relief-SBS,provides a new way for channel selection.
