EEG signals are often contaminated with artefacts, particularly with large signals generated by eye blinks. Deletion of artefact can lose valuable data. Current methods of removing the eye blink component to leave residual EEG, such as blind source component removal, require multichannel recording, are computationally intensive, and can alter the original EEG signal.
