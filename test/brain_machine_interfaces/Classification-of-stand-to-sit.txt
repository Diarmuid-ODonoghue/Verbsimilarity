Recent studies have demonstrated decoding of lower extremity limb kinematics from noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG), showing feasibility for development of an EEG-based brain-machine interface (BMI) to restore mobility following paralysis. Here, we present a new technique that preserves the statistical richness of EEG data to classify movement state from time-embedded low frequency EEG signals. We tested this new classifier, using cross-validation procedures, during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit activity in 10 subjects and found decoding accuracy of greater than 95% on average. These results suggest that this classification technique could be used in a BMI system that, when combined with a robotic exoskeleton, can restore functional movement to individuals with paralysis.
