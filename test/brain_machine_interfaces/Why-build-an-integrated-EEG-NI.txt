In medical applications, neuroscience and brain-computer interface research, bimodal acquisition of brain activity using Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is at the moment achieved by combining separate commercial devices. We have investigated quantitatively whether dedicated hybrid systems exhibit more advantageous properties.
