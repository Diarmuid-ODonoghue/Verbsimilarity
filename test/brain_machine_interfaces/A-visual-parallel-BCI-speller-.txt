Spelling is one of the most important issues in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. This paper is to develop a visual parallel-BCI speller system based on the time-frequency coding strategy in which the sub-speller switching among four simultaneously presented sub-spellers and the character selection are identified in a parallel mode.
