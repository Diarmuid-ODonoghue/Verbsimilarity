In the study of the scalp electroencephalogram(EEG)-based brain-computer interface(BCI),individual differences and complex background noise are two main factors which affect the stability of BCI system.For different subjects,therefore,optimization of BCI system parameters is necessary,including the optimal designing of temporal and spatial filters parameters as well as the classifier parameters.In order to improve the accuracy of BCI system,this paper proposes a new BCI information processing method,which combines the optimization design of independent component analysis spatial filter(ICA-SF)with the multiple sub-band features of EEG signals.The four subjectsâ€™ three-class motor imagery EEG(MI-EEG)data collected in different periods were analyzed with the proposed method.Experimental results revealed that,during the inner and outer cross-validation of single subject as well as the subject-to-subject validation,the proposed multiple sub-band method always had higher average classification accuracy compared to those with single-band method,and the maximum difference could achieve 6.08% and5.15%,respectively.
