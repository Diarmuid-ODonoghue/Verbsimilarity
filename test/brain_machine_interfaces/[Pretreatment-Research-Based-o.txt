Most of electroencephalogram(EEG)acquired by multi-channels is difficult to be applied to the singlechannel brain-computer interface(BCI)in the EEG analysis method based on left and right hand motor imagery.The present research applied an improved independent component analysis(ICA)method to realize pretreatment of the EEG effectively.Firstly,data drift was removed through linear drift correction.Secondly,the number of virtual channels were increased by applying delayed window data and some EEG artifacts which are namely electrooculogram(EOG)and electrocardiogram(ECG)were removed by ICA.Finally,the average instantaneous energy characteristics were calculated and classified through the instantaneous amplitude which was solved by applying Hilbert-Huang transform(HHT).The experiment proves that the method completes the EEG pretreatment and improves classification ratio of single-channel EEG,and lays a foundation of single-channel and portable BCI.
