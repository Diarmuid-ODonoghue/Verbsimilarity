Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals have been developed to restore the communication function of severely paralyzed patients. However, the limited amount of information derived from ECoG signals hinders their clinical applications. We aimed to develop a method to decode ECoG signals using spatiotemporal patterns characterizing movement types to increase the amount of information gained from these signals.
