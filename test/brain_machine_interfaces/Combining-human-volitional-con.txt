Affording lower-limb amputees the ability to volitionally control robotic prostheses can improve the adaptability to terrain changes as well as enhancing proprioception. However, it also increases amputees' conscious burdens for prosthesis control. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to propose a hybrid controller which combines human volitional control with the intrinsic controller on the robotic transtibial prosthesis, enabling the amputee actively controlling prosthesis with little conscious attention. In this preliminary study, a hybrid controller for adaptive slope walking was designed. A slope estimator was embedded in the intrinsic controller to estimate the ground slope of the previous step using signals measured by prosthetic sensors. And a myoelectric controller allows the amputee subject to convey slope changes to prosthetic controller by volitionally contract his residual muscles, whose electromyography signals were mapped to the slope increment. The hybrid controller combined these two results to obtain the estimated slope. One male transtibial amputee subject was recruited in this research. Experiment results showed that the intrinsic slope estimator produced satisfactory estimation results with an average absolute error of 0.70 Â± 0.54 degrees. By adding amputee's volitional control, the hybrid controller is able to predict the upcoming slope changes.
