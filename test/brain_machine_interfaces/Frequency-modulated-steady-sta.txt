Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are widely used for brain-computer interfaces. However, users experience fatigue due to exposure to flickering stimuli. High-frequency stimulation has been proposed to reduce this problem. We adapt frequency-modulated (FM) stimulation from the auditory domain, where it is commonly used to evoke steady-state responses, and compare the EEG as well as behavioral flicker perceptibility ratings.
