Organic electrochemical transistors are integrated on depth probes to achieve localized electrical stimulation of neurons. The probes feature a mechanical delamination process which leaves only a 4 Î¼m thick film with embedded transistors inside the brain. This considerably reduces probe invasiveness and correspondingly improves future brain-machine interfaces.
