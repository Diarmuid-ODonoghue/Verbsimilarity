Desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythmic activity increases instantaneous corticospinal excitability, as indexed by amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The accumulative effect of cortical stimulation in conjunction with sensorimotor desynchronization is, however, unclear.
