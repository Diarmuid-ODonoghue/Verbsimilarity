Brain-computer interface (BCI) algorithm development has long been hampered by two major issues: small sample sets and a lack of reproducibility. We offer a solution to both of these problems via a software suite that streamlines both the issues of finding and preprocessing data in a reliable manner, as well as that of using a consistent interface for machine learning methods.
