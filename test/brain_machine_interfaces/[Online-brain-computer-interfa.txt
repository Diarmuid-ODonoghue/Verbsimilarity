In the research of non-invasive brain-computer interface(BCI), independent component analysis(ICA) has been considered as a promising method of electroencephalogram(EEG) preprocessing and feature enhancement. However, there have been few investigations and implements about online ICA-BCI system up till now.This paper reports the investigation of the ICA-based motor imagery BCI(MIBCI) system, combining the characteristics of unsupervised learning of ICA and event-related desynchronization(ERD) related to motor imagery. We constructed a simple and practical method of ICA spatial filter calculation and discriminate criterion of three-type motor imageries in the study. To validate the online performance of proposed algorithms, an ICA-MIBCI experimental system was fully established based on Neuro Scan EEG amplifier and VC++ platform. Four subjects participated in the experiment of MIBCI testing and two of them took part in the online experiment. The average classification accuracies of the three-type motor imageries reached 89.78% and 89.89% in the offline and online testing, respectively. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm produced high classification accuracy and required less time consumption, which would have a prospect of cross platform application.
