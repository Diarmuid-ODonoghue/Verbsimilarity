Given the high prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), we examined the performance of a novel computerized cognitive assessment device (NCAD) for the evaluation of neurocognitive impairment in the setting of HIV. In addition to a standard 8-test neuropsychological battery, each participant underwent testing with the NCAD, which requires approximately 20 min and has been shown to accurately measure neurocognition in elderly individuals. The NCAD yields seven subtest scores in addition to an overall predictive score that is calculated based on subtest results. Thirty-nine HIV-infected participants were included in this study; the majority of which (71.8 %) had undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels and a history of significant immunocompromise (median nadir CD4+ count 34 cells/μl). The mean composite neuropsychological score (NPT-8) was 46.07, and mean global deficit score (GDS) was 0.59. NCAD total subtest accuracy correlated significantly with NPT-8 (Pearson correlation r = 0.59, p < 0.0001) as well as GDS (Spearman's rho = -0.36, p = 0.02). NCAD predictive score also correlated significantly with NPT-8 (Spearman's rho = -0.5601, p = 0.0016) and GDS (Spearman's rho = 0.45, p = 0.0144). When using the most recent nosology of HAND criteria for neurocognitive impairment, the area under the curve (AUC) for NCAD total subtest accuracy was 0.7562 (p = 0.012), while the AUC for the HIV dementia scale was 0.508 (p = 0.930). While not as comprehensive as a full neuropsychological battery, the NCAD shows promise as a rapid screening tool for HIV-infected individuals, and additional research of this device is indicated.
