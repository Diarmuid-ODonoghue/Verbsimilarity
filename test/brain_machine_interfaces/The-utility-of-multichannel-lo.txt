Local field potentials (LFPs) that carry information about the subject's motor intention have the potential to serve as a complement or alternative to spike signals for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). The goal of this study is to assess the utility of LFPs for BMIs by characterizing the largely unknown information coding properties of multichannel LFPs.
