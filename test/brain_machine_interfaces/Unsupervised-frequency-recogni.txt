Recently developed effective methods for detection commands of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) that need calibration for visual stimuli, which cause more time and fatigue prior to the use, as the number of commands increases. This paper develops a novel unsupervised method based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for accurate detection of stimulus frequency.
