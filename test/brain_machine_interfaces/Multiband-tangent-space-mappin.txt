When designing multiclass motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI), a so-called tangent space mapping (TSM) method utilizing the geometric structure of covariance matrices is an effective technique. This paper aims to introduce a method using TSM for finding accurate operational frequency bands related brain activities associated with MI tasks.
