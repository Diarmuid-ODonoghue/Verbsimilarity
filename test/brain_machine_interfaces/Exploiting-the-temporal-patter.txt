When visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are deployed in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the emphasis is put on stimulus design. In the case of transient VEPs (TVEPs) brain responses are never treated individually, i.e. on a single-trial (ST) basis, due to their poor signal quality. Therefore their main characteristic, which is the emergence during early latencies, remains unexplored.
