Recently, we proposed a new stimulation paradigm for brain computer interfaces (BCI) based on event-related potentials (ERP), i.e. flashing characters with superimposed pictures of well-known faces. This new face flashing (FF) paradigm significantly outperformed the commonly used character flashing (CF) approach, i.e. simply highlighting characters.
