Since the mid-1950s, neurosurgery has benefited from the remarkable progress due to tremendous advances in neuroimaging techniques, neuroanesthesia, neurostimulation, and brain-computer interfaces, as well as breakthroughs in operating microscopes and surgical instruments. Yet, this specialty has to do with delicate human structures and is hence considered as highly risky by insurance companies. In France, although neurosurgery's casualty rate (6%) is lower than in other specialties, the number of legal prosecutions has increased since 2002 because of easier access to medicolegal procedures. In order to avoid patients' resorting to the law courts, it becomes necessary to clearly identify the risk factors.
