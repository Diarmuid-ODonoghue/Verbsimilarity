Seven autopsy patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in totally locked-in state (TLS) were examined neuropathologically. The patients were composed of 4 males and 3 females, and 3 with familial, 1 sporadic but with mutation in SOD1 gene, and 3 sporadic patients with unremarkable gene mutation. The brains weighed 715, 783, 1,019, 1,050, 1,170, 1,190 or 1,233 g. The tegmentum of the brain stem was markedly degenerated in every patient, and the tracts relating to the somatic sensory and auditory were involved in the lesions.
