Brain signals can be used to extract relevant features to decode various limb movement parameters such as the direction of upper limb movements. Amplitude based feature extraction techniques have been used to study such motor activity of upper limbs whereas phase synchrony, used to estimate functional relationship between signals, has rarely been used to study single hand movements in different directions.
