Most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) require that users perform mental tasks such as motor imagery, mental arithmetic, or music imagery to convey a message or to answer simple yes or no questions. These cognitive tasks usually have no direct association with the communicative intent, which makes them difficult for users to perform.
