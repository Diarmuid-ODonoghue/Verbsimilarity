One of the challenges in the area of brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is to develop an asynchronous BCI or a self-paced BCI that detects whether a user intends to pass messages. This paper proposes a novel asynchronous BCI that uses mixed frequency and phase-coded visual stimuli, which can provide high-speed and accurate command entries.
