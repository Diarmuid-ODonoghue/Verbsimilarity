Operating a brain-computer interface (BCI) is a skill that individuals must learn. A recent study demonstrated that successful skill acquisition enables human individuals to control telepresence robotic devices in three-dimensional physical space using the non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG). Although the results are very promising, there is room for improvement in the future.
