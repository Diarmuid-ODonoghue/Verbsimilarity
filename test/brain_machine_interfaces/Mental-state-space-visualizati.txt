Numerous studies in the area of BCI are focused on the search for a better experimental paradigm-a set of mental actions that a user can evoke consistently and a machine can discriminate reliably. Examples of such mental activities are motor imagery, mental computations, etc. We propose a technique that instead allows the user to try different mental actions in the search for the ones that will work best.
