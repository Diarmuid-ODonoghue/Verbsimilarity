Motor imagery (MI) related features are typically extracted from a fixed frequency band and time window of EEG signal. Meanwhile, the time when the brain activity associated with the occurring task varies from person to person and trial to trial. Thus, some of the discarded EEG data with time may contain MI-related information.
