Ten individuals were divided into two feedback and no-feedback groups. The effect of abstract visual feedback was investigated in these two groups. Using eight electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes, the induced event-related desynchronization/synchronization of the EEG of three motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) was analyzed by wavelet and spatial filtering methods. Linear discriminant analysis was used to classify the three imagery tasks. Each imagery task's total length was set to 3 s and 1 s of it was used for the classification. The classification result was shown to the subjects of the feedback group in a real-time manner as an abstract visual feedback. While the paired t-test of the first and third sessions of the training days confirmed the improvement of the motor imagery learning in the feedback group (p<0.01), the motor imagery learning of the no-feedback group was not significant.
