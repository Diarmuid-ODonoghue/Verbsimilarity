Feedback plays a crucial role for using brain computer interface systems. This paper proposes the use of vibration-evoked kinaesthetic illusions as part of a novel multisensory feedback for a motor imagery (MI)-based BCI and investigates its contributions in terms of BCI performance and electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates.
