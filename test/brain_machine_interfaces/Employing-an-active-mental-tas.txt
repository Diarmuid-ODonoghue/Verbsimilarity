A majority of auditory brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use the attentional modulation of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) for communication and control. This study investigated whether the performance of an ERP-based auditory BCI can be further improved by increasing the mental efforts associated with the execution of the attention-related task.
