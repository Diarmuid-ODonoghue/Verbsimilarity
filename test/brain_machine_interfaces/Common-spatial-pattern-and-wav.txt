Recently, hybrid brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) combining more than one modality have been investigated with the aim of boosting the performance of the existing single-modal BCIs in terms of accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR). Previously, we introduced a novel hybrid BCI in which EEG and fTCD modalities are used simultaneously to measure electrical brain activity and cerebral blood velocity during motor imagery (MI) tasks.
