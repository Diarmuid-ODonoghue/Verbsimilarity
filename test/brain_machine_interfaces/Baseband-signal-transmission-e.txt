We demonstrate image signal transmission for wireless intra-brain communication. As a preliminary experiment, transmission characteristics of the brain phantom were measured. The baseband output signal from an implantable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor is transmitted through the phantom. The image was successfully reproduced from the received signal.
