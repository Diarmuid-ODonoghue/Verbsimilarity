Neurofeedback of event-related desynchronization (ERD) in electroencephalograms (EEG) of the sensorimotor cortex (SM1) using a brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm is a powerful tool to promote motor recovery from post-stroke hemiplegia. However, the feedback delay attenuates the degree of motor learning and neural plasticity.
