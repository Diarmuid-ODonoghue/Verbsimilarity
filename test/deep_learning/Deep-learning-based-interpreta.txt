Basal/acetazolamide brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been used to evaluate functional hemodynamics in patients with carotid artery stenosis. We aimed to develop a deep learning model as a support system for interpreting brain perfusion SPECT leveraging unstructured text reports.
