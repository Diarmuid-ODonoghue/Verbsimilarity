Cerebral revascularization in the deep surgical field is technically challenging. Especially, side-to-side anastomosis like A3-A3 could be technically more difficult compared with end-to-side anastomosis. To improve surgeon's dexterity and maneuverability in the deep surgical field, the authors developed an easily accessible and well-simulating training system using prosthetic tubes and a box.
