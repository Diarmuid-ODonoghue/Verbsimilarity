Human papillomavirus vaccination and cervical screening are lacking in most lower resource settings, where approximately 80% of more than 500â€‰000 cancer cases occur annually.

The objective of this study was to develop a "deep learning"-based visual evaluation algorithm that automatically recognizes cervical precancer/cancer.
