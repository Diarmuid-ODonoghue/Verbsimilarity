Transcription factor (TF) binds to the promoter region of a gene to control gene expression. Identifying precise TF binding sites (TFBSs) is essential for understanding the detailed mechanisms of TF-mediated gene regulation. However, there is a shortage of computational approach that can deliver single base pair resolution prediction of TFBS.
