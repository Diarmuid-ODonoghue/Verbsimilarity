In this issue, Wester etÂ al. (2019) examine the obligate relationship between cortical interneurons and pyramidal neurons. By genetically converting superficial IT pyramidal cells into PT-like deep-layer pyramidal cells, they alter the position, connectivity, and gene expression within CGE-derived interneurons.
