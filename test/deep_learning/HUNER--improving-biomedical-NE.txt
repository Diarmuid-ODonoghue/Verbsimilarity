Several recent studies showed that the application of deep neural networks advanced the state-of-the-art in named entity recognition (NER), including biomedical NER. However, the impact on performance and the robustness of improvements crucially depends on the availability of sufficiently large training corpora, which is a problem in the biomedical domain with its often rather small gold standard corpora.
