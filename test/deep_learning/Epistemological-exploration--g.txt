Among 139 students (mean age 21.8, SD=3.5), use of Schmeck's Deep Processing learning style (looking for conceptual understanding) on academic materials correlated modestly with its use on religious materials. The same was true for Elaborative Processing (looking for associations and applications). Both Deep and Elaborative Processing of academic materials correlated with better Analytical Skills. Only Elaborative Processing of religious materials correlated with Religiousness. Religiousness correlated with poorer Analytical Skills on academic materials and with a more Concrete Divine Concept; however, specific religious affiliation made a difference. Our understanding of the role of contents of materials and characteristics of learners on the types of learning strategies used and competence with cognitive skills is still very limited.
