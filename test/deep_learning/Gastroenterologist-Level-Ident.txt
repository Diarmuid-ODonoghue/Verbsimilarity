Capsule endoscopy has revolutionized investigation of the small bowel. However, this technique produces a video that is 8-10 hours long, so analysis is time consuming for gastroenterologists. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can recognize specific images among a large variety. We aimed to develop a CNN-based algorithm to assist in the evaluation of small bowel capsule endoscopy (SB-CE) images.
