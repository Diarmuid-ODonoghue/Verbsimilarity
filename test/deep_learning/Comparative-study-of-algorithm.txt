Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning is limited by the fact that the electron density distribution required for dose calculation is not readily provided by MR imaging. We compare a selection of novel synthetic CT generation algorithms recently reported in the literature, including segmentation-based, atlas-based and machine learning techniques, using the same cohort of patients and quantitative evaluation metrics.
