Serial electrocardiography aims to contribute to electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis by comparing the ECG under consideration with a previously made ECG in the same individual. Here, we present a novel algorithm to construct dedicated deep-learning neural networks (NNs) that are specialized in detecting newly emerging or aggravating existing cardiac pathology in serial ECGs.
