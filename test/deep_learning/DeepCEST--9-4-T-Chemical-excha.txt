To determine the feasibility of employing the prior knowledge of well-separated chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) signals in the 9.4 T Z-spectrum to separate overlapping CEST signals acquired at 3 T, using a deep learning approach trained with 3 T and 9.4 T CEST spectral data from brains of the same subjects.
