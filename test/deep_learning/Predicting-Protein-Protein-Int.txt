Identifying protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is of paramount importance for understanding cellular processes. Machine learning-based approaches have been developed to predict PPIs, but the effectiveness of these approaches is unsatisfactory. One major reason is that they randomly choose non-interacting protein pairs (negative samples) or heuristically select non-interacting pairs with low quality.
