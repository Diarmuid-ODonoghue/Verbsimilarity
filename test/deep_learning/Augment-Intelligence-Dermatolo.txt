Although deep learning algorithms have shown expert-level performance, previous efforts were mostly binary classifications of limited disorders. We trained an algorithm with 220,680 images of 174 disorders and validated using Edinburgh (1,300 images; 10 disorders) and SNU dataset (2,201 images; 134 disorders). The algorithm could accurately predict malignancy, suggest primary treatment options, render multi-class classification among 134 disorders and improve the performance of medical professionals. The AUCs for malignancy detection were 0.928±0.002 (Edinburgh) and 0.937±0.004 (SNU). The AUCs of primary treatment suggestion (SNU) were 0.828±0.012, 0.885±0.006, 0.885±0.006 and 0.918±0.006 for steroids, antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals. For multi-class classification, the mean Top-1/Top-5 accuracies were 56.7±1.6%/92.0±1.1% (Edinburgh) and 44.8±1.2%/78.1±0.3% (SNU). With the assistance of our algorithm, the sensitivity and specificity of 47 clinicians (21 dermatologists and 26 dermatology residents) for malignancy prediction (SNU; 240 images) improved by 12.1% (p<0.0001) and 1.1% (p<0.0001), respectively. The malignancy prediction sensitivity of 23 general public significantly increased by 83.8% (p<0.0001). The Top-1 and 3 accuracy of 4 doctors in the multi-class classification of 134 diseases (SNU; 2,201 images) increased by 7.0% (p=0.045) and 10.1% (p=0.0020), respectively. The results suggest that our algorithm may serve as an Augmented Intelligence that can empower medical professionals in diagnostic dermatology.
