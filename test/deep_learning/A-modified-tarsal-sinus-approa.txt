Plate fixation using traditional lateral L-shape approach for intra-articular calcaneal fractures is complicated by 30% of wound complications, and the lateral small incision techniques with a tarsal sinus approach cannot sufficiently address all the fragments. A modified tarsal sinus approach with combined advantages of traditional lateral L-shape and tarsal sinus approaches for the treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures was developed.
