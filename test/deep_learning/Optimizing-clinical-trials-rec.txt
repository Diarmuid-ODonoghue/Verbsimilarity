Clinical trials, prospective research studies on human participants carried out by a distributed team of clinical investigators, play a crucial role in the development of new treatments in health care. This is a complex and expensive process where investigators aim to enroll volunteers with predetermined characteristics, administer treatment(s), and collect safety and efficacy data. Therefore, choosing top-enrolling investigators is essential for efficient clinical trial execution and is 1 of the primary drivers of drug development cost.
