OBJECTIVE. We provide overviews of deep learning approaches used by two top-placing teams for the 2018 Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Pneumonia Detection Challenge. CONCLUSION. Practical applications of deep learning techniques, as well as insights into the annotation of the data, were keys to success in accurately detecting pneumonia on chest radiographs for the competition.
