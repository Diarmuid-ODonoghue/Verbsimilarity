The growing availability of rich clinical data such as patients' electronic health records provide great opportunities to address a broad range of real-world questions in medicine. At the same time, artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML)-based approaches have shown great premise on extracting insights from those data and helping with various clinical problems. The goal of this study is to conduct a systematic comparative study of different ML algorithms for several predictive modeling problems in urgent care.
