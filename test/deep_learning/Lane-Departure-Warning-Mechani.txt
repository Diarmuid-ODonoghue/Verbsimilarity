Neglecting the driver behavioral model in lane-departure-warning systems has taken over as the primary reason for false warnings in human-machine interfaces. We propose a machine learning-based mechanism to identify drivers' unintended lane-departure behaviors, and simultaneously predict the possibility of driver proactive correction after slight departure. First, a deep residual network for driving state feature extraction is established by combining time series sensor data and three serial ReLU residual modules. Based on this feature network, online extreme learning machine is organized to identify a driver's behavior intention, such as unconscious lane-departure and intentional lane-changing. Once the system senses unconscious lane-departure before crossing the outermost warning boundary, the ϵ-greedy LSTM module in shadow mode is roused to verify the chances of driving the vehicle back to the original lane. Only those unconscious lane-departures with no drivers' proactive correction behavior are transferred into the warning module, guaranteeing that the system has a limited false alarm rate. In addition, naturalistic driving data of twenty-one drivers are collected to validate the system performance. Compared with the basic time-to-line-crossing (TLC) method and the TLC-DSPLS method, the proposed warning mechanism shows a large-scale reduction of 12.9% on false alarm rate while maintaining the competitive accuracy rate of about 98.8%.
