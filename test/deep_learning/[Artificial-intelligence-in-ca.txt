Less than 10 years ago a breakthrough was made in the world of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) with the application of deep neural networks, which initially found little attention in medicine. In 2017 the first high-ranking publications on the medical application of AI were published. The potential of AI became known to many both in clinical medicine as well as in clinical and biomedical research. At the end of 2019 a phase of upheaval is occurring: first concepts for regulatory procedures have appeared, a large number of start-ups but also established companies are endeavoring to introduce AI-based medical devices into the market. This article discusses the basic principles for understanding AI-based medical devices as well as an overview of current AI-based solutions specific to cardiac surgery.
