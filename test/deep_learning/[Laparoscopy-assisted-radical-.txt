Presently we note a standardization of techniques for laparoscopy assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy (LARVH). Altgassen et al. pointed to this fact with their evaluation of 108 operations for cervical cancer. They considered the necessity to perform 100 such operations before standardizing this method. In our survey we compare a similar number of operations performed in our department in order to prove whether Altgassen's thesis is correct, taking peri- and postoperative parameters as well as complications into consideration. For this purpose we analyzed the number of operations necessary to develop and standardize laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy combined with radical vaginal hysterectomy in women treated for cervical cancer.
