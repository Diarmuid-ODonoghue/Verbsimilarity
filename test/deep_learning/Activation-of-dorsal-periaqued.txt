Electrical or glutamate stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) of rats induces overt defensive behavior, such as freezing or flight, and hyponociception, while glycine and D-serine, a specific NMDA/GLY(B)-site ligand, produced only subtle defensive behavior related to risk assessment and avoidance from the open arms in the elevated plus-maze test. In order to verify whether the GLY(B) site in the DPAG could also be involved in hyponociception, glycine (GLY; 10, 20, 50, and 80 nmol/0.3 microl) and (+/-)-3-amino-1-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone (HA966; 10 nmol/0.3 microl), a GLY(B)-site antagonist, were microinjected in rats submitted to the radiant heat-induced tail-flick test. GLY increased tail-flick latencies in a dose-dependent way. This hyponociceptive effect was completely reversed by co-administration with HA966. GLY given in the deep layer of superior colliculus did not produce changes in tail-flick latencies. Therefore, the results suggest that the activation of GLY(B) receptors in the DPAG is also involved in the hyponociception elicited by this brain area.
