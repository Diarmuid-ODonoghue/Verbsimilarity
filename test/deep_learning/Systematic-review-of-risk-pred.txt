Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of morbidity and a preventable cause of deaths following lower limb joint replacement. Risk prediction scores that help to predict individual VTE risk following lower limb joint replacement may inform the development of preventive strategies and guide treatment decisions. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on the development and/or validation of risk prediction scores for VTE following lower limb joint replacement.
