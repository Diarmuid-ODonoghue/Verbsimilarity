Accurate tumor segmentation is a requirement for magnetic resonance (MR)-based radiotherapy. Lack of large expert annotated MR datasets makes training deep learning models difficult. Therefore, a cross-modality (MR-CT) deep learning segmentation approach that augments training data using pseudo MR images produced by transforming expert-segmented CT images was developed.
