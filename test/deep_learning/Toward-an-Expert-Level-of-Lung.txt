Computed tomography (CT) is essential for pulmonary nodule detection in diagnosing lung cancer. As deep learning algorithms have recently been regarded as a promising technique in medical fields, we attempt to integrate a well-trained deep learning algorithm to detect and classify pulmonary nodules derived from clinical CT images.
