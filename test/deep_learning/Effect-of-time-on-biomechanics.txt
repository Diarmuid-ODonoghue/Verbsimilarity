Mechanistic studies of the Functional Re-adaptive Exercise Device (FRED) have shown it automatically recruits Lumbar Multifidus (LM) and Transversus Abdominis (TrA) - two deep-spinal muscles that are atrophied and show altered motor control in low back pain (LBP). No studies have investigated the time required to familiarise to FRED exercise, which is required to inform future FRED based clinical trial protocols. This study therefore determined the effect of time, during FRED exercise, on biomechanical outcome measures, to establish the familiarisation period, and assess for loss of technique throughout a ten minute trial. A cohort comparison study of 148 participants, 70 experiencing low back pain, had lumbopelvic kinematics, exercise frequency and movement variability measured during a 10 minute trial. Magnitude-based inference was used to assess for familiarisation, using plots of variation over time with familiarised reference ranges. The no pain group took 170 seconds, and the back pain group took 150 seconds, to familiarise. A familiarisation period of at least 170 seconds (2.8 minutes) is recommended. This justifies, and provides a familiarisation time for use of the FRED as a motor control intervention.
