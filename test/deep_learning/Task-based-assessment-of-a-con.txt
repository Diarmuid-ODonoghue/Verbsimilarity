Radiomics allows for powerful data-mining and feature extraction techniques to guide clinical decision making. Image segmentation is a necessary step in such pipelines and different techniques can significantly affect results. We demonstrate that a convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation method performs comparably to expert manual segmentations in an established radiomics pipeline.
