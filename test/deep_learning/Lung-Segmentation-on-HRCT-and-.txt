A robust lung segmentation method using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed and evaluated on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and volumetric CT of various types of diffuse interstitial lung disease (DILD). Chest CT images of 617 patients with various types of DILD, including cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), were scanned using HRCT (1-2-mm slices, 5-10-mm intervals) and volumetric CT (sub-millimeter thickness without intervals). Each scan was segmented using a conventional image processing method and then manually corrected by an expert thoracic radiologist to create gold standards. The lung regions in the HRCT images were then segmented using a two-dimensional U-Net architecture with the deep CNN, using separate training, validation, and test sets. In addition, 30 independent volumetric CT images of UIP patients were used to further evaluate the model. The segmentation results for both conventional and deep-learning methods were compared quantitatively with the gold standards using four accuracy metrics: the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and Hausdorff surface distance (HSD). The mean and standard deviation values of those metrics for the HRCT images were 98.84 ± 0.55%, 97.79 ± 1.07%, 0.27 ± 0.18 mm, and 25.47 ± 13.63 mm, respectively. Our deep-learning method showed significantly better segmentation performance (p < 0.001), and its segmentation accuracies for volumetric CT were similar to those for HRCT. We have developed an accurate and robust U-Net-based DILD lung segmentation method that can be used for patients scanned with different clinical protocols, including HRCT and volumetric CT.
