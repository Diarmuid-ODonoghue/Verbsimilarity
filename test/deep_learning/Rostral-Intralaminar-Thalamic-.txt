Rostral intralaminar thalamic nucleus (ILN) has been shown to modulate cognition through indirect connection with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We explored the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the rostral ILN on spatial memory acquisition, brain neuronal activation and cortical and hippocampal synaptic changes in rats.
