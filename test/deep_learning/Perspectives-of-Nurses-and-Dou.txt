Sweden is rapidly becoming an increasingly multicultural and digitalized society. Encounters between pediatric nurses and migrant mothers, who are often primary caregivers, are impeded by language problems and cultural differences.

In addition, information and communication technology (ICT) can potentially be used to manage interactions owing to its accessibility.
