In a double-blind randomized crossover trial, we previously established that bilateral deep brain stimulation of the anteromedial globus pallidus internus (GPiam-DBS) is effective in significantly reducing tic severity in patients with refractory Tourette syndrome (TS). Here, we report the effects of bilateral GPiam-DBS on cognitive function in 11 of the 13 patients who had participated in our double-blind cross-over trial of GPi-DBS.
