Clathrin is an adaptor protein that serves as the principal element of the vesicle-coating complex and is important for the membrane cleavage to dispense the invaginated vesicle from the plasma membrane. The functional loss of clathrins has been tied to a lot of human diseases, i.e., neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, Alzheimer's diseases, and so on. Therefore, creating a precise model to identify its functions is a crucial step towards understanding human diseases and designing drug targets.
