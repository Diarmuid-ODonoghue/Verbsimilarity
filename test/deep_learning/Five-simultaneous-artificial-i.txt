The goal of this data challenge was to create a structured dynamic with the following objectives: (1) teach radiologists the new rules of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), while building a large multicentric prospective database of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and MRI patient images; (2) build a network including radiologists, researchers, start-ups, large companies, and students from engineering schools, and; (3) provide all French stakeholders working together during 5 data challenges with a secured framework, offering a realistic picture of the benefits and concerns in October 2018.
