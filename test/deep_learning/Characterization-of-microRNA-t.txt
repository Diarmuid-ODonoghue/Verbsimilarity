MicroRNAs are a class of regulatory molecules involved in a wide variety of biological processes, including growth, development, and apoptosis. Given the widespread roles of microRNAs in biological processes, understanding their different expression profiles in normal, adjacent, and tumor tissues will provide insights into the consequences of aberrant expression.
