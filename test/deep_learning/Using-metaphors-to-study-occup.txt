The aim of this case study was to explore transitions of an injured worker suffering from multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), and his lived experiences in learning to function in everyday life with this injury. To date, little research exists about the transitions of a worker to an injured worker beyond the focus of strategies in returning to work and rehabilitation.
