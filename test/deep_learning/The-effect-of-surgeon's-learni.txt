The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence and type of complications during and after hip arthroscopy as well as the effect of the surgeon's learning curve on the occurrence of complications. We expect that the currently reported prevalence especially of minor complications is likely to be underreported in most retrospective series based on chart analysis.
