GPs at the Deep End first started in Scotland and brought together Scottish general practitioners (GPs) working in the 100 most deprived practices in the country. The group continues to provide peer support, advocacy, training and research opportunities to learn more about general practice in disadvantaged areas. In 2016, Canberra GPs came together to form a local Deep End group, supported by the Scottish initiators.
