This paper addresses localization of needles inserted both in-plane and out-of-plane in challenging ultrasound-guided interventions where the shaft and tip have low intensity. Our approach combines a novel digital subtraction scheme for enhancement of low-level intensity changes caused by tip movement in the ultrasound image and a state-of-the-art deep learning scheme for tip detection.
