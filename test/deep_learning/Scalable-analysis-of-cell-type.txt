Recent advances in large-scale single-cell RNA-seq enable fine-grained characterization of phenotypically distinct cellular states in heterogeneous tissues. We present scScope, a scalable deep-learning-based approach that can accurately and rapidly identify cell-type composition from millions of noisy single-cell gene-expression profiles.
