Reliable automated segmentation of the prostate is indispensable for image-guided prostate interventions. However, the segmentation task is challenging due to inhomogeneous intensity distributions, variation in prostate anatomy, among other problems. Manual segmentation can be time-consuming and is subject to inter- and intraobserver variation. We developed an automated deep learning-based method to address this technical challenge.
