Rosacea is one of the most common cutaneous disorder characterized primarily by facial flushing, erythema, papules, pustules, telangiectases, and nasal swelling. Diagnosis of rosacea is principally done by a physical examination and a consistent patient history. However, qualitative human assessment is often subjective and suffers from a relatively high intra- and inter-observer variability in evaluating patient outcomes.
