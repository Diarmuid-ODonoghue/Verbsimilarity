Volumetric assessment of meningiomas represents a valuable tool for treatment planning and evaluation of tumor growth as it enables a more precise assessment of tumor size than conventional diameter methods. This study established a dedicated meningioma deep learning model based on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and evaluated its performance for automated tumor segmentation.
