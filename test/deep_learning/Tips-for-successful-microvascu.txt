The internal mammary vessels (IMVs) are increasingly the recipients for free flap breast reconstruction (FFBR). Access traditionally entails removing a segment of the third costal cartilage. Despite excellent exposure, some authors have reported localized tenderness as well as a thoracic contour deformity. We introduced the "total rib preservation" technique for IMV exposure after specific request by a patient, and have used it for all subsequent reconstructions.
