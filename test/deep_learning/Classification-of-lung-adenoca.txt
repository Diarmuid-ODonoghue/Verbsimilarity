Convolutional neural networks have become rapidly popular for image recognition and image analysis because of its powerful potential. In this paper, we developed a method for classifying subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma from pathological images using neural network whose that can evaluate phenotypic features from wider area to consider cellular distributions.
