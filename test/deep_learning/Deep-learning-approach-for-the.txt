We developed a deep learning algorithm for the automatic segmentation and quantification of intraretinal cystoid fluid (IRC) in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volumes independent of the device used for acquisition. A cascade of neural networks was introduced to include prior information on the retinal anatomy, boosting performance significantly. The proposed algorithm approached human performance reaching an overall Dice coefficient of 0.754 Â± 0.136 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.936, for the task of IRC segmentation and quantification, respectively. The proposed method allows for fast quantitative IRC volume measurements that can be used to improve patient care, reduce costs, and allow fast and reliable analysis in large population studies.
