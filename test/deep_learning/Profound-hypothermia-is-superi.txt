Rapid induction of profound hypothermia can improve survival from uncontrolled lethal hemorrhage. However, the optimal depth of hypothermia in this setting remains unknown. This experiment was designed to compare the impact of deep (15 degrees C), profound (10 degrees C), and ultraprofound (5 degrees C) hypothermia on survival and organ functions.
