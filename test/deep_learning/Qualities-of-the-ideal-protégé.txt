The purpose of this paper is to share what I view as 10 important qualities of an ideal protégé. First, protégés must have a deep-seated love of learning that drives them to make the most out of the mentoring partnership. Next, protégés must be self-starters who take personal charge of their mentoring. Confidence is vital so that the junior officer can face the many challenges that lay ahead in any Army career. Careful risk taking is necessary so that the protégé can reach his or her greatest potential. Bouncing back from mistakes and failures is crucial for protégés, so they must be resilient. Ongoing enthusiasm is the fuel that sustains the mentoring relationship over time. By being open-minded, a protégé carefully considers all advice, including constructive criticism, that the mentor shares along the uphill path to wisdom. Remember that commitment is the very glue holding the mentoring relationship together. Also, protégés remain loyal to their mentors by always maintaining confidences. Most important, an ideal protégé is truly grateful for all the things that the mentor has done and repays that debt by also becoming a mentor. In closing, it is hoped that by developing these qualities, present and future protégés will get the most out of their mentoring partnerships and keep the age-old spirit of mentorship alive.
