Microscope images are information rich. In this issue of Cell, Christiansen etÂ al. show that label-free images of cells can be used to predict fluorescent labels representing cell type, state, and organelle distribution using a deep-learning framework. This paves the way for computationally multiplexed assays derived from inexpensive label-free microscopy.
