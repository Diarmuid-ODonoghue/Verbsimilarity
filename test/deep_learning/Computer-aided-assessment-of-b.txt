Breast density is one of the most significant factors that is associated with cancer risk. In this study, our purpose was to develop a supervised deep learning approach for automated estimation of percentage density (PD) on digital mammograms (DMs). The input 'for processing' DMs was first log-transformed, enhanced by a multi-resolution preprocessing scheme, and subsampled to a pixel size of 800 µm  ×  800 µm from 100 µm  ×  100 µm. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was trained to estimate a probability map of breast density (PMD) by using a domain adaptation resampling method. The PD was estimated as the ratio of the dense area to the breast area based on the PMD. The DCNN approach was compared to a feature-based statistical learning approach. Gray level, texture and morphological features were extracted and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to combine the features into a feature-based PMD. With approval of the Institutional Review Board, we retrospectively collected a training set of 478 DMs and an independent test set of 183 DMs from patient files in our institution. Two experienced mammography quality standards act radiologists interactively segmented PD as the reference standard. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for model selection and evaluation with the training set. With cross-validation, DCNN obtained a Dice's coefficient (DC) of 0.79  ±  0.13 and Pearson's correlation (r) of 0.97, whereas feature-based learning obtained DC  =  0.72  ±  0.18 and r  =  0.85. For the independent test set, DCNN achieved DC  =  0.76  ±  0.09 and r  =  0.94, while feature-based learning achieved DC  =  0.62  ±  0.21 and r  =  0.75. Our DCNN approach was significantly better and more robust than the feature-based learning approach for automated PD estimation on DMs, demonstrating its potential use for automated density reporting as well as for model-based risk prediction.
