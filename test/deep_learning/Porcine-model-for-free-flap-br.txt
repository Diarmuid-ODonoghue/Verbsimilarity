Free-flap breast reconstruction is a challenging surgical procedure with a steep learning curve. A reproducible large animal model could be relevant for free-flap harvesting and microsurgical anastomosis training. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a porcine model for free-flap breast reconstruction.
