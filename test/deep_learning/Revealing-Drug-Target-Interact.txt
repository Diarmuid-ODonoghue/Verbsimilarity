Identifying possible drug-target interactions (DTIs) has become an important task in drug research and development. Although high-throughput screening is becoming available, experimental methods narrow down the validation space because of extremely high cost, low success rate, and time consumption. Therefore, various computational models have been exploited to infer DTI candidates.
