Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a major signaling molecule that the brain uses to control a vast network of intracellular cascades fundamental to properties of learning and memory, and cognition. While much is known about BDNF signaling in the healthy nervous system where it controls the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclic-AMP pathways, less is known about its role in multiple brain disorders where it contributes to the dysregulated neuroplasticity seen in epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). We previously found that neurons respond to prolonged BDNF exposure (both in vivo (in models of epilepsy and TBI) and in vitro (in BDNF treated primary neuronal cultures)) by activating the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. This pathway is best known for its association with inflammatory cytokines in non-neuronal cells.
