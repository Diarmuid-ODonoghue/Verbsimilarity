The purpose of this study is to determine whether a convolutional neural network (CNN) can predict the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of lymph nodes in patients with cancer using the unenhanced CT images from a PET/CT examination, thus providing a proof of concept for potentially using deep learning to diagnose nodal involvement.
