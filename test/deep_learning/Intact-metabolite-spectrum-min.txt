To develop a robust method for brain metabolite quantification in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that maps in vivo brain spectra that are typically degraded by low SNR, line broadening, and spectral baseline into noise-free, line-narrowed, baseline-removed intact metabolite spectra.
