Human Down syndrome (DS) is usually caused by genomic micro-duplications and dosage imbalances of human chromosome 21. It is associated with many genomic and phenotype abnormalities. Even though human DS occurs about 1 per 1,000 births worldwide, which is a very high rate, researchers haven't found any effective method to cure DS. Currently, the most efficient ways of human DS prevention are screening and early detection.
