Computational methods for protein post-translational modification (PTM) site prediction provide a useful approach for studying protein functions. The prediction accuracy of the existing methods has significant room for improvement. A recent deep-learning architecture, Capsule Network (CapsNet), which can characterize the internal hierarchical representation of input data, presents a great opportunity to solve this problem, especially using small training data.
