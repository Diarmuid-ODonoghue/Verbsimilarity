The aim of this study was to develop a fully automated deep learning approach for identification of the pectoral muscle on mediolateral oblique (MLO) view mammograms and evaluate its performance in comparison to our previously developed texture-field orientation (TFO) method using conventional image feature analysis. Pectoral muscle segmentation is an important step for automated image analyses such as breast density or parenchymal pattern classification, lesion detection, and multiview correlation.
