This paper introduces a fully automated, subject-specific deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) system for forecasting seizures using ambulatory intracranial EEG (iEEG). The system was tested on a hand-held device (Mayo Epilepsy Assist Device) in a pseudo-prospective mode using iEEG from four canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.
