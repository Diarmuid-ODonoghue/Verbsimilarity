Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in MRI plays an increasingly important role in diagnostic applications and developing imaging biomarkers. Automated whole-breast segmentation is an important yet challenging step for quantitative breast imaging analysis. While methods have been developed on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, automatic whole-breast segmentation in breast DWI MRI is still underdeveloped.
