Unsupervised machine learning methods (deep learning) have shown their usefulness with noisy single cell mRNA-sequencing data (scRNA-seq), where the models generalize well, despite the zero-inflation of the data. A class of neural networks, namely autoencoders, has been useful for denoising of single cell data, imputation of missing values and dimensionality reduction.
