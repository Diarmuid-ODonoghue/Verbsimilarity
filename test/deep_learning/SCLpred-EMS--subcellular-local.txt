The subcellular location of a protein can provide useful information for protein function prediction and drug design. Experimentally determining the subcellular location of a protein is an expensive and time-consuming task. Therefore, various computer-based tools have been developed, mostly using machine learning algorithms, to predict the subcellular location of proteins.
