Spectral computed tomography (CT) has the capability to resolve the energy levels of incident photons, which has the potential to distinguish different material compositions. Although material decomposition methods based on x-ray attenuation characteristics have good performance in dual-energy CT imaging, there are some limitations in terms of image contrast and noise levels.
