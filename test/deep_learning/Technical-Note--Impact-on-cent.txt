We use central frequency ratio and noise magnitude ratio from noise power spectrum (NPS) to evaluate the noise reduction techniques of ASiR and ASiR-V of GE, SAFIRE and ADMIRE of Siemens, and PixelShine of AlgoMedica. ASiR, ASiR-V, SAFIRE and ADMIRE use a combination of image and projection data whereas PixelShine uses artificial intelligence neural network for noise reduction.
