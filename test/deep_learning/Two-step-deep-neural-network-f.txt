Patients with migraine show an increased presence of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), especially deep WMHs. Segmentation of small, deep WMHs is a critical issue in managing migraine care. Here, we aim to develop a novel approach to segmenting deep WMHs using deep neural networks based on the U-Net.
