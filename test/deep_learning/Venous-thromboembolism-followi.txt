There is wide variability in reported venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence following total shoulder replacement (TSR) or total elbow replacement (TER). It is uncertain which risk factors influence the risk of VTE following TSR or TER. We conducted a PRISMA compliant meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence, temporal trends and potential risk factors for VTE following primary TSR and TER.
