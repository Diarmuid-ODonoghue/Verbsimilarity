Admission computed tomography (CT) is a widely used diagnostic tool for patients with pelvic fractures. In this pilot study, we hypothesized that pelvic hematoma volumes derived using a rapid automated deep learning-based quantitative visualization and measurement algorithm predict interventions and outcomes including (a) need for angioembolization (AE), pelvic packing (PP), or massive transfusion (MT), and (b) in-hospital mortality.
