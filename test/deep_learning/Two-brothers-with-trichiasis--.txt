Two brothers with very similar phenotypes involving trichiasis (misdirected lashes), entropion with corneal abrasions, strabismus, progressive thinning of the scalp hair, sensorineural hearing impairment, mild learning difficulties, and inguinal hernias are described. They have similar, distinctive facial features with deep-set eyes, a high nasal bridge and a short philtrum. Both brothers are carriers of a maternally inherited apparently balanced translocation of chromosomes 11 and 18: 46,XY, t(11;18)(p13;q21)mat. However, this is thought to be coincidental, since their younger brother also carries this translocation and is phenotypically normal. Although they have many features that are found in the ectodermal dysplasia syndromes, their combination of features is distinct and has to our knowledge not been previously reported.
