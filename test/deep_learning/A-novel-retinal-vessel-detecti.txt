Computer aided detection (CAD) offers an efficient way to assist doctors to interpret fundus images. In a CAD system, retinal vessel (RV) detection is a crucial step to identify the retinal disease regions. However, RV detection is still a challenging problem due to variations in morphology of the vessels on noisy and low contrast fundus images.
