The purpose of this study was to segment the left ventricle (LV) blood pool, LV myocardium, and right ventricle (RV) blood pool of end-diastole and end-systole frames in free-breathing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Automatic and accurate segmentation of cardiac structures could reduce the postprocessing time of cardiac function analysis.
