Professional development should help a professional person look at life from the first line, with deep knowledge in his field, with his own opinion, with know-how, with a critical sense, with something to say and something to add. This is IDER's philosophy based on having students develop their scientific, technical and human capacities, relating their experiences with the knowledge provided by textbooks, by other professional by other students, by consultations and scientific work. And always at one's own rhythm because IDER has specialized in continuing professional development from afar.
