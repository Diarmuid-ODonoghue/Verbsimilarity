Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) affects the small arteries, arterioles, venules and capillaries in the brain and can be identified clinically and/or radiologically. We describe the case of a 71-year-old man with sporadic cerebral SVD who presented with acute paraplegia with urinary incontinence and recent cognitive impairment that developed after the occurrence of ischaemic lesions.
