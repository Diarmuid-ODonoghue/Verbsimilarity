The World Health Organization (WHO) grading system of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) plays an important role in the clinical decision. The rarity of PNET often negatively affects the radiological application of deep learning algorithms due to the low availability of radiological images. We tried to investigate the feasibility of predicting WHO grades of PNET on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images by deep learning algorithms.
