Visual inspection, lesion detection, and differentiation between malignant and benign features are key aspects of an endoscopist's role. The use of machine learning for the recognition and differentiation of images has been increasingly adopted in clinical practice. This study aimed to establish convolutional neural network (CNN) models to automatically classify gastric neoplasms based on endoscopic images.
