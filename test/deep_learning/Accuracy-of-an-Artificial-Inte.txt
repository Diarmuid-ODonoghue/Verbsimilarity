The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a novel fully automated deep learning (DL) algorithm implementing a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) for the detection of coronary artery calcium (CAC) from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data.
