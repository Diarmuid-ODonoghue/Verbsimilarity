Cancer will replace cardiovascular diseases as the most frequent cause of death. Therefore, the goals of cancer treatment are prevention strategies and early detection by cancer screening and ideal stage therapy.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal laser microscopy (CLM) are two techniques that have the potential to complement intraoperative frozen section analysis as in vivo and real-time optical biopsies.
