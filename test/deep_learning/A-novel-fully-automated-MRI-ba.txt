Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status has emerged as an important prognostic marker in gliomas. Currently, reliable IDH mutation determination requires invasive surgical procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop a highly accurate, MRI-based, voxelwise deep-learning IDH classification network using T2-weighted (T2w) MR images and compare its performance to a multicontrast network.
