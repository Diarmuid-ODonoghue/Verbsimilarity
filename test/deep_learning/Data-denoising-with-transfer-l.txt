Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are noisy and sparse. Here, we show that transfer learning across datasets remarkably improves data quality. By coupling a deep autoencoder with a Bayesian model, SAVER-X extracts transferable gene-gene relationships across data from different labs, varying conditions and divergent species, to denoise new target datasets.
