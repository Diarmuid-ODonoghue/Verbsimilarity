Standard segmentation of high-contrast electron micrographs (EM) identifies myelin accurately but does not translate easily into measurements of individual axons and their myelin, even in cross-sections of parallel fibers. We describe automated segmentation and measurement of each myelinated axon and its sheath in EMs of arbitrarily oriented human white matter from autopsies.
