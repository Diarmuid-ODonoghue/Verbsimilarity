Ureter injuries are the most dreaded complication in gynecological surgery. Some risk factors for the occurrence of urinary tract injuries are known, but clear guidelines to prevent ureter injuries during laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) are lacking. The aim of this study was to analyze all known ureter injuries that occurred during LH for a benign indication in the Netherlands, in order to identify patient- and surgeon-related risk factors.
