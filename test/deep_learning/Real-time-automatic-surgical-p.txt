Automatic surgical workflow recognition is a key component for developing the context-aware computer-assisted surgery (CA-CAS) systems. However, automatic surgical phase recognition focused on colorectal surgery has not been reported. We aimed to develop a deep learning model for automatic surgical phase recognition based on laparoscopic sigmoidectomy (Lap-S) videos, which could be used for real-time phase recognition, and to clarify the accuracies of the automatic surgical phase and action recognitions using visual information.
