Segmentation of thigh muscle and adipose tissue is important for the understanding of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Therefore, the purpose of this work is (a) to evaluate whether a fully automated approach provides accurate segmentation of muscles and adipose tissue cross-sectional areas (CSA) compared with manual segmentation and (b) to evaluate the validity of this method based on a previous clinical study.
