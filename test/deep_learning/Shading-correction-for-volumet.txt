Shading artifact may lead to CT number inaccuracy, image contrast loss and spatial non-uniformity (SNU), which is considered as one of the fundamental limitations for volumetric CT (VCT) application. To correct the shading artifact, a novel approach is proposed using deep learning and an adaptive filter (AF).
