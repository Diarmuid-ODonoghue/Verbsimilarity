Accurate and timely organs-at-risk (OARs) segmentation is key to efficient and high-quality radiation therapy planning. The purpose of this work is to develop a deep learning-based method to automatically segment multiple thoracic OARs on chest computed tomography (CT) for radiotherapy treatment planning.
