In clinical practice, invasiveness is an important reference indicator for differentiating the malignant degree of subsolid pulmonary nodules. These nodules can be classified as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), or invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). The automatic determination of a nodule's invasiveness based on chest CT scans can guide treatment planning. However, it is challenging, owing to the insufficiency of training data and their interclass similarity and intraclass variation. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage deep learning strategy for this task: prior-feature learning followed by adaptive-boost deep learning.
