In-line holographic microscopy provides an unparalleled wealth of information about the properties of colloidal dispersions. Analyzing one colloidal particle's hologram with the Lorenz-Mie theory of light scattering yields the particle's three-dimensional position with nanometer precision while simultaneously reporting its size and refractive index with part-per-thousand resolution. Analyzing a few thousand holograms in this way provides a comprehensive picture of the particles that make up a dispersion, even for complex multicomponent systems. All of this valuable information comes at the cost of three computationally expensive steps: (1) identifying and localizing features of interest within recorded holograms, (2) estimating each particle's properties based on characteristics of the associated features, and finally (3) optimizing those estimates through pixel-by-pixel fits to a generative model. Here, we demonstrate an end-to-end implementation that is based entirely on machine-learning techniques. Characterizing and Tracking Colloids Holographically (CATCH) with deep convolutional neural networks is fast enough for real-time applications and otherwise outperforms conventional analytical algorithms, particularly for heterogeneous and crowded samples. We demonstrate this system's capabilities with experiments on free-flowing and holographically trapped colloidal spheres.
