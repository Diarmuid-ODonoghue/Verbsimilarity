Macroscopic fluorescence lifetime imaging (MFLI) via compressed sensed (CS) measurements enables efficient and accurate quantification of molecular interactions in vivo over a large field of view (FOV). However, the current data-processing workflow is slow, complex and performs poorly under photon-starved conditions. In this paper, we propose Net-FLICS, a novel image reconstruction method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), to directly reconstruct the intensity and lifetime images from raw time-resolved CS data. By carefully designing a large simulated dataset, Net-FLICS is successfully trained and achieves outstanding reconstruction performance on both in vitro and in vivo experimental data and even superior results at low photon count levels for lifetime quantification.
