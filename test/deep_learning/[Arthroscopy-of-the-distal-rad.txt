Insertion of a small joint arthroscope into the proximal and distal parts of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) allows visualization of the proximal pouch of the DRUJ, the joint surfaces of the sigmoid notch and the ulnar head, the convexity of the ulnar head and the proximal ulnar-sided surface of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).
