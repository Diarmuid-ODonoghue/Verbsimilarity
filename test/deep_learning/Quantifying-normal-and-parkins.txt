Gait movies recorded in daily clinical practice are usually not filmed with specific devices, which prevents neurologists benefitting from leveraging gait analysis technologies. Here we propose a novel unsupervised approach to quantifying gait features and to extract cadence from normal and parkinsonian gait movies recorded with a home video camera by applying OpenPose, a deep learning-based 2D-pose estimator that can obtain joint coordinates from pictures or videos recorded with a monocular camera.
