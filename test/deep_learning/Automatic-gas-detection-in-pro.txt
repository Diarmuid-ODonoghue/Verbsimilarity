The detection of intestinal/rectal gas is very important during image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer patients because intestinal/rectal gas increases the inter- and intra-fractional prostate motion. We propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect intestinal/rectal gas in the pelvic region.
