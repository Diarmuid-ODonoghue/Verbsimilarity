Renewed interest in total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) has developed globally as a result of recent literature supporting new-generation implants as a viable alternative to arthrodesis. The literature also demonstrates a learning curve among surgeons adopting TAA. The purpose of this study is to better define this learning curve for surgeons using third-generation implants.
