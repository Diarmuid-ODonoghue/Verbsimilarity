We propose a new deep learning-based approach to provide more accurate whole-body PET/MRI attenuation correction than is possible with the Dixon-based 4-segment method. We use activity and attenuation maps estimated using the maximum-likelihood reconstruction of activity and attenuation (MLAA) algorithm as inputs to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a CT-derived attenuation map. Methods: The whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT scan data of 100 cancer patients (38 men and 62 women; age, 57.3 ± 14.1 y) were retrospectively used for training and testing the CNN. A modified U-net was trained to predict a CT-derived μ-map (μ-CT) from the MLAA-generated activity distribution (λ-MLAA) and μ-map (μ-MLAA). We used 1.3 million patches derived from 60 patients' data for training the CNN, data of 20 others were used as a validation set to prevent overfitting, and the data of the other 20 were used as a test set for the CNN performance analysis. The attenuation maps generated using the proposed method (μ-CNN), μ-MLAA, and 4-segment method (μ-segment) were compared with the μ-CT, a ground truth. We also compared the voxelwise correlation between the activity images reconstructed using ordered-subset expectation maximization with the μ-maps, and the SUVs of primary and metastatic bone lesions obtained by drawing regions of interest on the activity images. Results: The CNN generates less noisy attenuation maps and achieves better bone identification than MLAA. The average Dice similarity coefficient for bone regions between μ-CNN and μ-CT was 0.77, which was significantly higher than that between μ-MLAA and μ-CT (0.36). Also, the CNN result showed the best pixel-by-pixel correlation with the CT-based results and remarkably reduced differences in activity maps in comparison to CT-based attenuation correction. Conclusion: The proposed deep neural network produced a more reliable attenuation map for 511-keV photons than the 4-segment method currently used in whole-body PET/MRI studies.
