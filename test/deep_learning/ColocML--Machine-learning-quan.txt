Imaging mass spectrometry (imaging MS) is a prominent technique for capturing distributions of molecules in tissue sections. Various computational methods for imaging MS rely on quantifying spatial correlations between ion images, referred to as co-localization. However, no comprehensive evaluation of co-localization measures has ever been performed; this leads to arbitrary choices and hinders method development.
