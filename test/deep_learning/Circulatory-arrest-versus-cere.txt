For some surgical procedures to be done, a patient's blood circulation needs to be stopped. In such situations, the maintenance of blood flow to the brain is perceived beneficial even in the presence of deep hypothermia. We aimed to assess the benefits of the maintenance of antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) compared with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA).
