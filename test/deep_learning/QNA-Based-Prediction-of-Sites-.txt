Metabolism of xenobiotics (Greek xenos: exogenous substances) plays an essential role in the prediction of biological activity and testing for the subsequent research and development of new drug candidates. Integration of various methods and techniques using different computational and experimental approaches is one of the keys to a successful metabolism prediction. While multiple structure-based and ligand-based approaches to metabolism prediction exist, the most important problem arises at the first stage of metabolism prediction: detection of the sites of metabolism (SOMs). In this paper, we describe the application of Quantitative Neighborhoods of Atoms (QNA) descriptors for prediction of the SOMs using potential function method, as well as several different machine learning techniques: naïve Bayes, random forest classifier, multilayer perceptron with back propagation and convolutional neural networks, and deep neural networks.
