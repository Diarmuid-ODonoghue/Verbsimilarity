In cognitive neuroscience the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving complex classification tasks is yet to be fully exploited. The most limiting factor is that DNNs as notorious 'black boxes' do not provide insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel method to explain individual network decisions.
