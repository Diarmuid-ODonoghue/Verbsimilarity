The recent deep learning-based studies on the classification of schizophrenia (SCZ) using MRI data rely on manual extraction of feature vector, which destroys the 3D structure of MRI data. In order to both identify SCZ and find relevant biomarkers, preserving the 3D structure in classification pipeline is critical.
