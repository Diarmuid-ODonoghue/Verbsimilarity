Pervasive cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are a major cause of disability among individuals with the disorder. One such deficit is the loss of effective associative learning, which is readily assessed via eye-blink conditioning procedures. The authors examined the efficacy of secretin, a hormonal agonist for the prototype group B G-protein-coupled receptors, in ameliorating eye-blink conditioning deficits in schizophrenia patients.
