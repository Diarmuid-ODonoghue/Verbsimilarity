Azobenzene derivatives due to their photo- and electroactive properties are an important group of compounds finding applications in diverse fields. Due to the possibility of controlling the trans-cis isomerization, azo-bearing structures are ideal building blocks for development of e.g. nanomaterials, smart polymers, molecular containers, photoswitches, and sensors. Important role play also macrocyclic compounds well known for their interesting binding properties. In this article selected macrocyclic compounds bearing azo group(s) are comprehensively described. Here, the relationship between compounds' structure and their properties (as e.g. ability to guest complexation, supramolecular structure formation, switching and motion) is reviewed.
