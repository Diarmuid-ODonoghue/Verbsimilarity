Substantial effort has been devoted to both scientific and technological developments of wearable, flexible, semitransparent, and sensing electronics (e.g., organic/perovskite photovoltaics, organic thin-film transistors, and medical sensors) in the past decade. The key to realizing those functionalities is essentially the fabrication of conductive electrodes with desirable mechanical properties. Conductive polymers (CPs) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have emerged to be the most promising flexible electrode materials over rigid metallic oxides and play a critical role in these unprecedented devices as transparent electrodes, hole transport layers, interconnectors, electroactive layers, or motion-sensing conductors. Here, the current status of research on PEDOT:PSS is summarized including various approaches to boosting the electrical conductivity and mechanical compliance and stability, directly linked to the underlying mechanism of the performance enhancements. Along with the basic principles, the most cutting edge-progresses in devices with PEDOT:PSS are highlighted. Meanwhile, the advantages and plausible problems of the CPs and as-fabricated devices are pointed out. Finally, new perspectives are given for CP modifications and device fabrications. This work stresses the importance of developing CP films and reveals their critical role in the evolution of these next-generation devices featuring wearable, deformable, printable, ultrathin, and see-through characteristics.
