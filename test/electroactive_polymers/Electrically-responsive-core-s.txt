It is an active research field to develop fiber-shaped smart materials for biomedical applications. Here we report the development of the multifunctional core-shell hybrid microfibers with excellent mechanical and electrical performance as a new smart biomaterial. The microfibers were synthesized using a combination of co-axial spinning with a microfluidic device and subsequent dip-coating, containing a hydrogel core of bacterial cellulose (BC) and a conductive polymer shell layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The hybrid microfibers were featured with a well-controlled microscopic morphology, exhibiting enhanced mechanic properties. A model drug, diclofenac sodium, can be loaded in the core layer of the microfibers in situ during the process of synthesis. Our experiments suggested that the releasing behaviors of the drug molecules from the microfibers were enhanced by external electrical stimulation. Interestingly, we demonstrated an excellent biocompatibility and electroactivity of the hybrid microfibers for PC12 cell culture, thus promising a flexible template for the reconstruction of electrically-responsive tissues mimicking muscle fibers or nerve networks.
