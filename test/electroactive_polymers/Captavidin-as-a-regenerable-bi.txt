Captavidin, a nitrated avidin with moderate affinity with biotin, irreversibly adsorbs on carboxymethylcellulose to form a regenerable biorecognition element for biotin. This layer was retained and stabilized on a boron-doped diamond electrode by a Nafion film for repeated impedance analyses of biotin down to below 1 nM. The labeless electrochemical sensing scheme was then demonstrated for the analysis of biotin in blood plasma. The incorporation of captavidin confers detection specificity and regenerability, whereas the Nafion and carboxymethylcellulose layers circumvent the diffusion of endogenous electroactive species. The biosensing layer is simply regenerated by applying oxidation of +2 V for 1 min instead of its submersion in carbonate buffer for 10 min.
