Novel two-dimensional (2D) cross-linked polysiloxane LB films were prepared and applied for glucose sensing as H2O2-permselective films in order to block other electroactive interferences, such as L-ascorbic acid, L-cysteine, uric acid and acetaminophen; the 2D cross-linked polysiloxane monolayers were remarkably effective in eliminating interfering responses and had a rapid response for glucose, even though the films were only a monolayer thick.
