In this paper, the results on horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed oxidative polymerization of amine-functionalized fluorene monomer, 2-amino fluorene (AF), are reported. The resulting polymer exhibits an exciting molecular structure and spectral properties. FT-IR and NMR studies show that the two fluorene units come together by forming an intermediate six-membered pyrazine ring and these formed dimeric units are linked to the each other through C-C couplings to produce fully conjugated polymer structure (AFP). Further characterizations were performed by means of GPC, TGA, DSC, SEM, CV (cyclic voltammetry), fluorescence analyses, and solubility tests. Optical band gaps of this electroactive polymer was found to be 2.60 eV. AFP emits red light and its emission maxima is drastically affected by the kind of the solvents used. In addition, obtained polymer is soluble in common polar and apolar organic solvents.
