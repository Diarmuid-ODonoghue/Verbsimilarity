Anodic oxidation of free base and manganese complexes of tetraspirobifluorenylporphyrins leads to the coating of the working electrode by insoluble electroactive poly(9,9'-spirobifluorene-free and manganese porphyrin) films which electrochemical behavior and physicochemical properties are described. After removal from the electrode, the manganese-complexed polymers were evaluated as catalysts for the oxidation of alkenes by iodobenzene diacetate or iodosylbenzene. The results show that the reactions proceeded very efficiently at room temperature with good yields. The electrosynthesized polymer catalysts can be recycled by simple filtration and reused even up to the eighth cycle without loss of activity and selectivity. These results represent an important improvement over those previously described for manganese-porphyrin-catalyzed epoxidation reactions.
