Injectable hydrogels made of degradable biomaterials can function as both physical support and cell scaffold in preventing infarct expansion and promoting cardiac repair in myocardial infarction therapy. Here, we report in situ hydrogels consisting of thermosensitive PolyNIPAM-based copolymers and electroactive tetraaniline (TA). Studies showed that the addition of 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane (MDO) provided the PolyNIPAM-based gel with biodegradability, and the introduction of tetraaniline endowed these copolymers with desirable electrical properties and antioxidant activities. The encapsulated H9c2 cells (rat cardiac myoblast) remained highly viable in the gel matrices. In vivo gel formation and histological analyses were performed in rats by subcutaneous injection and excellent biocompatibility was observed. Furthermore, the proliferation and intracellular calcium transients of H9c2 cells were also studied with (and without) electrical stimuli. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that electroactive hydrogel may be used as a promising injectable biomaterial for cardiac tissue engineering.
