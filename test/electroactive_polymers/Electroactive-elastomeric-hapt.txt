This paper presents a novel approach used to develop haptic displays of motility of organs and compliance of tissues, aimed at combining structural simplicity with realistic appearance and consistence. The dielectric elastomer actuation technology was used to mimic mechanical passive properties and electromechanical active functions of tissues by means of electroresponsive elastomeric devices. Proof-of-concept displays were conceived for medical training in cardiology and surgical force feedback in minimally invasive procedures. In particular, prototype displays of cardiac contractility, pulsatile blood pressure, and compliance of soft tissues were manufactured with silicone and acrylic elastomers. Preliminary physical and psychophysical tests suggested the feasibility of the considered approach, while emphasizing required improvements.
