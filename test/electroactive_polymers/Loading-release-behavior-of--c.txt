In the present work, positively charged chitosan (CS) and negatively charged DNA were alternately adsorbed on the surface of pyrolytic graphite (PG) electrodes, forming (CS/DNA)(n) layer-by-layer films. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) results showed that negatively charged electroactive probe, 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), could be loaded into the (CS/DNA)(n) films from its solution (1 mM at pH 7.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl), designated as (CS/DNA)(n)-AQDS, and then released from the films in blank buffers. The loading/release behavior of (CS/DNA)(n) films toward AQDS was found to be obviously different between double-stranded (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The release rate of AQDS from (CS/dsDNA)(n) films was much slower than that from the ssDNA counterparts mainly because AQDS could be intercalated into the double helix structure of dsDNA despite the repulsion between likely charged AQDS and DNA. The loading/release behavior of (CS/DNA)(n) films toward AQDS in recognition of dsDNA and ssDNA was then successfully applied to electrochemically detect the damage of natural DNA caused by Fenton reaction. To further understand the essence of the interactions involved in the AQDS loading/release process for (CS/DNA)(n) films, comparison experiments were performed, in which either positively charged intercalator brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) was used to replace AQDS as the redox probe, or poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) with relatively high positive charge density was used to replace CS as the constituent of layer-by-layer films with DNA. The loading/release behavior of DNA films toward electroactive intercalator may open new possibilities for dsDNA/ssDNA recognition and of DNA damage detection by electrochemistry.
