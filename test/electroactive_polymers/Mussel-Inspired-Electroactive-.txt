Wound repair and tissue regeneration are complex processes that involve many physiological signals. Thus, employing novel wound dressings with potent biological activity and physiological signal response ability to accelerate wound healing is a possible solution. Herein, inspired by mussel chemistry, we developed a polydopamine (PDA)-reduced graphene oxide (pGO)-incorporated chitosan (CS) and silk fibroin (SF) (pGO-CS/SF) scaffold with good mechanical, electroactive, and antioxidative properties as an efficient wound dressing. First, pGO with good dispersibility and cell affinity was obtained upon reduction by PDA under alkali conditions. Second, pGO was dispersed into a CS/SF mixture, and then CS and SF chains were dual-cross-linked by poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether and glutaraldehyde to obtain a pGO-incorporated gel. Finally, the gel underwent a freeze-dry process to obtain the pGO-CS/SF scaffold. Owing to PDA reduction and functionalization, pGO in the scaffold plays important roles for the performances of the scaffolds. First, the pGO acts as nanoreinforcement to enhance the mechanical properties of the scaffold by combining the dual-cross-linked CS/SF network. Second, the uniformly distributed pGO in the scaffolds comprises a well-connected electric pathway, which can provide a channel for the transmission of electrical signals in the scaffold. Moreover, pGO in the scaffolds serves as an antioxidant agent to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and therefore terminates excessive ROS oxidation. In vitro studies show that electroactive pGO-CS/SF scaffolds can respond to electrical signals and promote cytological behavior. In addition, the pGO-CS/SF scaffolds can reduce cellular oxidation by removing excessive ROS. The in vivo full-thickness skin defect model demonstrates that the electroactive and antioxidative pGO-CS/SF scaffold can efficiently enhance wound healing. In summary, the pGO-CS/SF scaffold is a promising wound dressing because of its ability to promote physiological electrical signal transmission for cell growth and reduce ROS oxidation, resulting in an improved wound regeneration effect.
