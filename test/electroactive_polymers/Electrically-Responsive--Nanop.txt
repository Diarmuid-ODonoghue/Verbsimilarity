Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) assembled layer-by-layer have emerged as functional polymer films that are both stable and capable of containing drug molecules for controlled release applications. Most of these applications concentrate on sustained release, where the concentration of the released molecules remains rather constant with time. However, high-efficiency delivery requires obtaining high local concentrations at the vicinity of the cells, which is achieved by triggered release. Here, we show that a nanopatterned PEM platform demonstrates superior properties with respect to drug retention and triggered delivery. A chemically modified block copolymer film was used as a template for the selective deposition of poly(ethylene imine) and a charged derivative of the electroactive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) together with a drug molecule. This nanopatterned PEM shows the following advantages: (1) high drug loading; (2) enhanced retention of the bioactive molecule; (3) release triggered by an electrochemical stimulus; (4) high efficacy of drug delivery to cells adsorbed on the surface compared to the delivery efficacy of a similar concentration of drug to cells suspended in a solution.
