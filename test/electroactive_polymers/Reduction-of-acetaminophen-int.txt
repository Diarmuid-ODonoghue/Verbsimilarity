Amperometric glucose sensors typically monitor the production of hydrogen peroxide generated in the course of the enzymatic oxidation of glucose. At the applied potential necessary to oxidize the peroxide produced, other species are also electroactive and contribute to the signal. Interference of ascorbate or urate has been effectively eliminated, but that resulting from the widely used analgesic acetaminophen is not. The aim of this work was to reduce this interference, which was found to be possible by introducing a membrane constructed of Nafion. We compared the in vitro sensitivity to acetaminophen of five Nafion sensors with that of five non-Nafion sensors with identical glucose sensitivity (2.0 +/- 0.4 vs 1.9 +/- 0.1 nA.mmol-1.l-1, NS): sensitivity to acetaminophen was 12.2 +/- 2.7 vs 30.8 +/- 6.3 nA.mmol-1.l-1, respectively (p < 0.05). These sensors were tested in rats by implanting in each animal one Nafion and one non-Nafion sensors. The in vivo sensitivity to glucose was similar (0.33 +/- 0.09 vs 0.30 +/- 0.05 nA.mmol-1.l-1, NS). The current generated by an acetaminophen infusion (plasma acetaminophen plateau = 140 +/- 10 mumol/l) was much decreased in the case of the Nafion sensor: 0.5 +/- 0.3 vs 2.0 +/- 0.7 nA, p < 0.05). Five Nafion sensors were implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of normal human volunteers who were given on oral dose of 500 mg acetaminophen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).
