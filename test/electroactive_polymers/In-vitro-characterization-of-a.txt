In an effort to reduce organ replacement and enhance tissue repair, there has been a tremendous effort to create biomechanically optimized scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. In contrast, the development and characterization of electroactive scaffolds has attracted little attention. Consequently, the creation and characterization of a carbon nanotube based poly(lactic acid) nanofiber scaffold is described herein. After 28 d in physiological solution at 37 °C, a change in the mass, chemical properties and polymer morphology is seen, while the mechanical properties and physical integrity are unaltered. No adverse cytotoxic affects are seen when mesenchymal stem cells are cultured in the presence of the scaffold. Taken together, these data auger well for electroactive tissue engineering.
