A new approach for the integration of dual contactless conductivity and amperometric detection with an electrophoresis microchip system is presented. The PDMS layer with the embedded channels was reversibly sealed to a thin glass substrate (400 microm), on top of which a palladium electrode had been previously fabricated enabling end-channel amperometric detection. The thin glass substrate served also as a physical wall between the separation channel and the sensing copper electrodes for contactless conductivity detection. The latter were not integrated in the microfluidic device, but fabricated on an independent plastic substrate allowing a simpler and more cost-effective fabrication of the chip. PDMS/glass chips with merely contactless conductivity detection were first characterized in terms of sensitivity, efficiency and reproducibility. The separation efficiency of this system was found to be similar or slightly superior to other systems reported in the literature. The simultaneous determination of ionic and electroactive species was illustrated by the separation of peroxynitrite degradation products, i.e. NO(3)(-) (non-electroactive) and NO(2)(-) (electroactive), using hybrid PDMS/glass chips with dual contactless conductivity and amperometric detection. While both ions were detected by contactless conductivity detection with good efficiency, NO(2)(-) was also simultaneously detected amperometrically with a significant enhancement in sensitivity compared to contactless conductivity detection.
