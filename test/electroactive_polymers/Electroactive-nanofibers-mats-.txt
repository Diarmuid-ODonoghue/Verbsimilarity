The combination of scaffolds with desirable topographic characteristics and the use of electrical stimulus consist of a strategy to repair and regenerate tissues. An interesting approach to obtain electroactive scaffolds with the aforementioned features comprises on the use of conducting polymers which can be blended with other biocompatible polymers. In this work, poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) and poly(ortho-ethoxyaniline) (POEA) were synthesized and PLLA/POEA mats were prepared for the first time by electrospinning technique. Topographic characterization of PLLA/POEA showed a tunable mean diameter of the nanofibers by changing the electrospinning parameters. The presence of POEA into the blend was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. Differential scanning calorimetry curves of PLLA/POEA exhibited shift positions of Tc and absence of the exothermic peak related to the characteristic isomerization process of POEA at high temperatures. The thermal analysis results indicate a favored miscibility between the polymers which is likely resulted from the strong interaction between polymers functionalities. The homogenous distribution of POEA chains throughout the scaffold rendered redox reversibility property for the mats. Biocompatibility results showed non-cytotoxic features for PLLA/POEA, attesting this novel system as a promising candidate for biological applications.
