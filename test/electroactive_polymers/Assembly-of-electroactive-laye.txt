Layer-by-layer films were assembled on solid substrates by alternate adsorption of negatively charged ionomer poly(ester sulfonic acid) or Eastman AQ55 from its aqueous dispersion and positively charged myoglobin (Mb) from its solution at pH 4.5. The film assembly process was monitored by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV-vis spectroscopy, and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). [AQ/Mb](n) films grown on pyrolytic graphite (PG) electrodes showed a pair of well-defined and nearly reversible CV peaks at about -0.20 V vs Ag/AgCl in pH 5.5 buffers, characteristic of the Mb heme Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple. Although the amount of Mb adsorbed in each bilayer was essentially the same, the fraction of electroactive Mb decreased dramatically with an increase of bilayer number (n). Soret absorption bands of [AQ/Mb](n) films on glass slides suggest that Mb in the films retains its native state in the medium pH range. Trichloroacetic acid, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide were electrochemically catalyzed by [AQ/Mb](6) films with significant lowering of reduction overpotential.
