A nanocomposite of TiO2 nanoparticle with an electroactive poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) was synthesized via a simple surface thiol-lactam initiated radical polymerization upon grafting from protocol. This can be achieved through the primary modification of the TiO2 surface with a silane coupling agent leading to thiol functionalized TiO2 (TiO2-SH). Subsequently, a controlled radical polymerization of 4-vinylpyridine in the presence of TiO2-SH and butyrolactam afforded PVP-g-TiO2 nanocomposites. The grafting of PVP on the surface of TiO2 was confirmed by FT-IR, TGA, XPS, EDX, TEM and SEM analyses. The UV-vis studies of the synthesized PVP-g-TiO2 nanocomposite demonstrated an exceptionally good dispersibility in organic solvents.
