Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) embedded in a non-electroactive polymer are electrochemically characterized. The increasing voltammetric maximums obtained with rising temperature or electrolyte concentration point to a chemical nature of the processes. The chemical kinetic control of the processes is corroborated by its empirical chemical kinetics: the initial reaction rates are obtained from the chronoamperometric responses to potential steps. The activation energy of the reaction includes information about the structural state of the SWCNT before the potential step. Under constant current the potential evolution (chronopotentiometric response) and consumed electrical energy at any time change as a function of (are sensors of) the experimental temperature or the electrolyte concentration. The reactive material, or any device based on this material, senses these working variables, and shows dual and simultaneous actuating-sensing properties.
