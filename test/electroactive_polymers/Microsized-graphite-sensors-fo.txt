Two cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (CZ) microsized graphite selective sensors were investigated with dibutylsebacate as a plasticizer in a polymeric matrix of carboxylated polyvinyl chloride (PVC-COOH) in the case of sensor 1, based on the interaction between the drug and the dissociated COOH groups in the PVC-COOH. Sensor 2 was based on the interaction between the drug and ammonium reineckate, which acted as anionic electroactive material in the presence of polyvinyl chloride matrix. The two sensors were constructed by using 2-hydroxy propyl beta-cyclodextrin as an ionophore, which has a significant influence on increasing the membrane sensitivity and selectivity of both sensors. Fast and stable Nernstian responses of 1 x 10(-5) - 1 x 10(-2) and 1 x 10(-4) - 1 x 10(-2) M for the two sensors, respectively, with slopes of 58.6 and 55.5 mV/decade, respectively, over the pH range 2-4 were obtained. The proposed method displayed useful analytical characteristics for determination of CZ in its pure powder form with average recoveries 99.95 +/- 0.23 and 99.61 +/- 0.34% for sensors 1 and 2, respectively, and in plasma with good recoveries. The sensors were also used to determine the intact drug in the presence of its degradate and, thus, could be used as stability-indicating methods. The obtained results by the proposed methods were statistically analyzed and compared with those obtained by the U.S. Pharmacopeia method; no significant difference for either accuracy or precision was observed. Results obtained with the two electrodes revealed their performance characteristics, which were evaluated according to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry recommendations.
