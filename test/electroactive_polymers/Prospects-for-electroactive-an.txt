Electroactive and conducting framework materials, encompassing coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks, have captured the imagination of the scientific community owing to their highly designable nanoporous structures and their potential applications in electrochromic devices, electrocatalysts, porous conductors, batteries and solar energy harvesting systems, among many others. While they are now considered integral members of the broader field of inorganic materials, it is timely to reflect upon their strengths and challenges compared with 'traditional' solid-state materials such as minerals, pigments and zeolites. Indeed, the latter have been known since ancient times and have been prized for centuries in fields as diverse as art, archaeology and industrial catalysis. This opinion piece considers a brief historical perspective of traditional electroactive and conducting inorganic materials, with a view towards very recent experimental progress and new directions for future progress in the burgeoning area of coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks. Overall, this article bears testament to the rich history of electroactive solids and looks at the challenges inspiring a new generation of scientists. This article is part of the theme issue 'Mineralomimesis: natural and synthetic frameworks in science and technology'.
