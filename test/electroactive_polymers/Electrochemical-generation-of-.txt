The chemistry of electrochemically-driven myoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of styrene was investigated in films of DNA or Eastman AQ ionomer on optically transparent electrodes. Conversion of styrene to styrene oxide proceeded via a ferrylmyoglobin radical intermediate. Ferrylmyoglobins were clearly detected by spectroelectrochemistry in films of 1-4 mm thick. The ferrylmyoglobin radical is produced by reaction of metmyoglobin (Mb) in the films with hydrogen peroxide formed by electrochemical catalytic reduction of oxygen catalyzed by Mb. Thus, electrochemically-driven styrene oxidation with these films proceeds by a 'doubly catalytic' electrode-driven reduction-oxidation pathway. Ferrylmyoglobin formation during electrolysis of Mb-DNA films in aerobic solutions was much faster, and styrene oxidation occurred with less Mb decomposition compared to the Mb-AQ films. The better performance of Mb-DNA films is correlated with a larger fraction of electroactive Mb and better stability than for the Mb-AQ films.
