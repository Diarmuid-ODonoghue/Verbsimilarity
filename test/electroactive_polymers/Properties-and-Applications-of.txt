Poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, as one of important polymeric materials with extensively scientific interests and technological applications, shows five crystalline polymorphs with α, β, γ, δ and ε phases obtained by different processing methods. Among them, β phase PVDF presents outstanding electrical characteristics including piezo-, pyro-and ferroelectric properties. These electroactive properties are increasingly important in applications such as energy storage, spin valve devices, biomedicine, sensors and smart scaffolds. This article discusses the basic knowledge and character methods for PVDF fabrication and provides an overview of recent advances on the phase modification and recent applications of the β phase PVDF are reported. This study may provide an insight for the development and utilization for β phase PVDF nanofilms in future electronics.
