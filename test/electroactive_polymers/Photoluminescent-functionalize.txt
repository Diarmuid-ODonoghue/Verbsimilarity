Tissue engineering and stem cell rehabilitation are the hopeful aspects that are being investigated for the management of Myocardial Infarction (MI); cardiac patches have been used to start myocardial rejuvenation. In this study, we engineered p-phenylenediamine surface functionalized (modif-CQD) into the Silk fibroin/PLA (SF/PLA) nanofibrous bioactive scaffolds with improved physico-chemical abilities, mechanical and cytocompatibility to cardiomyocytes. The micrograph results visualized the morphological improved spherical modif-CQD have been equivalently spread throughout the SF/PLA bioactive cardiac scaffolds. The fabricated CQD@SF/PLA nanofibrous bioactive scaffolds were highly porous with fully consistent pores; effectively improved young modulus and swelling asset for the suitability and effective implantation efficacy. The scaffolds were prepared with rat cardiomyocytes and cultured for up to 7 days, without electrical incentive. After 7 days of culture, the scaffold pores all over the construct volume were overflowing with cardiomyocytes. The metabolic activity and viability of the cardiomyocytes in CQD@SF/PLA scaffolds were significantly higher than cardiomyocytes in Silk fibroin /PLA scaffolds. The integration of CQD also influenced greatly and increases the expression of cardiac-marker genes. The results of the present investigations evidently recommended that well-organized cardiac nanofibrous scaffold with greater cardiac related mechanical abilities and biocompatibilities for cardiac tissue engineering and nursing care applications.
