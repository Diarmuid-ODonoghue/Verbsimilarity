In this research, a new design of organic-inorganic hybrid networks involving covalently bonding, novel, electron-donating triphenylamine (TPA)-containing electroactive molecules to inorganic metal oxides is successfully developed by using a facile sol-gel process. These anodically electrochromic TPA-containing materials exhibit multicolor electrochromic behaviors at various oxidation states. By introducing zirconium oxide into electrochromic materials, not only can an excellent optical transparency in the visible light region at a neutral state be achieved given the nature of the large energy bandgap, but the electrochromic switching can also be driven by a lower oxidation potential with an enhanced response capability (shorter coloring times and bleaching times). Moreover, the hybrid films show outstanding electrochemical stability and high reversibility under long-term operations owing to their good adhesion to the electrode. Consequently, the electrochromic devices derived from these novel hybrid electroactive materials reveal a huge potential for electrochromic applications.
