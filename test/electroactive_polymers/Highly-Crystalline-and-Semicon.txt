Single-layer and multi-layer 2D polyimine films have been achieved through interfacial synthesis methods. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve the maximum degree of crystallinity in the 2D polyimines, which largely limits the long-range transport properties. Here we employ a surfactant-monolayer-assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS) method for the successful preparation of porphyrin and triazine containing polyimine-based 2D polymer (PI-2DP) films with square and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The synthetic PI-2DP films are featured with polycrystalline multilayers with tunable thickness from 6 to 200 nm and large crystalline domains (100-150 nm in size). Intrigued by high crystallinity and the presence of electroactive porphyrin moieties, the optoelectronic properties of PI-2DP are investigated by time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy. Typically, the porphyrin-based PI-2DP 1 film exhibits a p-type semiconductor behavior with a band gap of 1.38 eV and hole mobility as high as 0.01 cm2  V-1  s-1 , superior to the previously reported polyimine based materials.
