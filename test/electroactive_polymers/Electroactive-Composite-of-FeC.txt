Conducting polymers (CPs) is one of intelligent biomaterials with the specific properties of reversible redox states, which have a significant effects on the cell behaviors and nerve tissue regeneration. However, the effects of CPs with different electrical conductivity on the behaviors of nerve cells are rarely reported. Therefore, a kind of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with certain molecular weight is synthesized by Kumada catalyst transfer polymerization (KCTP) method and employed to prepare bioabsorbable and electroactive intelligent composites of Poly(3-hexylthiophene)/Poly(glycolide-lactide) (P3HT/PLGA). FeCl3 doping electroactive membranes with different electrical conductivities are prepared to investigate the cell behaviors. On the substrate with higher electrical conductivity, the proliferation of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) is significantly promoted and neurite length is increased obviously. In particular, the most significant improvements are the neuron gene expression of Synapsin 1 and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) by the composites with high conductivity. These results suggest that P3HT/PLGA with suitable electrical conductivity have a positive role in promoting neural growth and differentiation, which is promising for advancing potential application of nerve repair and regeneration.
