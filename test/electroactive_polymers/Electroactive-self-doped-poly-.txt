A novel poly(amic acid) with pendant aniline tetramer and sulfonic acid groups (ESPAA) was synthesized by ternary polymerization and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectra, ((1))H NMR and gel permeation chromatography. The polymer showed good thermal stability and excellent solubility in the common organic solvents. The electrochemical properties were investigated carefully on a CHI 660A Electrochemical Workstation. The polymer displayed good electroactivity in acid, neutral and even in alkaline solutions (pH=1-10) due to the self-doping effect between aniline tetramer and sulfonic/carboxylic acid groups. It also exhibited satisfactory electrochromic performance with high contrast value, acceptable coloration efficiency and fast switching time in the range of pH=1-9.
