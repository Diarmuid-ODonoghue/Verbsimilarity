Ultrathin films of a cross-linked and chemically distinct conjugated poly(p-phenylene) network via electropolymerization are described. The amphiphilic network precursor was synthesized by incorporating the alkoxy carbazole group (-O(CH2)5Cb) to a poly(p-phenylene) (C6PPPOH) backbone. In order to investigate the combined thin film electrochemical and photophysical properties of poly(p-phenylene)s and polycarbazole conjugated polymers, C6PPPC5Cb was deposited on substrates using the Langmuir Blodgett Kuhn (LBK) method. The monolayer isotherm of the polymer, C6PPPC5Cb, showed a liquid expanded region slightly different from the parent polymer C6PPPOH. Multilayers (up to 30 layers) were transferred to different substrates such as quartz, gold coated LaSFN9 and ITO substrates for analysis. For conversion to a conjugated polymer network (CPN) film, the electroactive carbazole group was electropolymerized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) resulting in polycarbazole linking units. The differences in the film properties and corresponding changes in the electrochemical behavior indicate the importance of film thickness and electron/ion transport process in cross linked network films. From the electrochemical studies, the scan rate was found to have a considerable effect on electropolymerization with higher oxidation and reduction peak values found for the rigid network polymer compared to the uncrosslinked polymers.
