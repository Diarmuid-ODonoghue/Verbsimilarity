Fabrication of precisely tailored layers of conductive polymers in thin film assemblies is an attractive extension of the layer-by-layer technique. This approach provides tools for fabricating thin films with customized optical and electrical properties. In this paper, we study inorganic layer-by-layer assembled films prepared using polyphosphate and cerium(IV). It is shown that these multilayers can oxidize certain monomers from the adjacent aqueous solution to produce conducting polymer layers. We studied the thermodynamic factors that allow the aforementioned autopolymerization. A five bilayer polyphosphate/cerium(IV) film was shown to possess high oxidative power in acidic solutions. It was found that the polymerization of pyrrole, aniline and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene in contact with the redox active multilayer is thermodynamically favored. The rate of polymer formation and the thickness of the conducting film could be controlled by the concentration of the monomer in solution and the number of cerium/polyphosphate bilayers in the oxidative film. The oxidative polymerization of pyrrole was unambiguously recognized on UV-vis spectra with characteristic reduction and oxidation bands. The film formation was not restricted by charge diffusion and the reaction formally followed first-order kinetics. The results suggest that the reaction takes place effectively within the whole pre-existing polypyrrole film and it continues until all oxidant in the film was used. The spectral changes that are characteristic for conducting polypyrrole are shown on spectroelectrochemical analysis of the films indicating that cationic (polaron) and dicationic (bipolaron) species are involved in the redox processes of the film. The functional polymer films formed are found to be electroactive and conducting. Therefore, they fully resemble of conducting polymer films prepared using traditional electropolymerization.
