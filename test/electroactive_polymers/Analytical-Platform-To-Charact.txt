Characterizing doping effects in a conductive polymer and physical diffusion in a passive polymer were performed using a remote-gate field-effect transistor (RG FET) detection system that was able to measure the electrical potential perturbation of a polymer film coupled to the gate of a silicon FET. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) film doped using various concentrations of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) solutions imposed additional positive potentials on the P3HT RG, resulting in a lower threshold voltage ( Vth) on the n-channel silicon FET. Changes in Vth were related to the induced hole concentrations and hole mobility in P3HT films by using our Vth shifting model for the RG FET. We discovered that the electron-donating P3HT and even inorganic materials, indium tin oxide and gold, showed similar electrical potential perturbations dependent on the concentration of F4TCNQ in overlying solutions as the dopant radical anions maximally covered the surfaces. This suggests that there are limited electroactive sites for F4TCNQ binding on electron donor surfaces which results in a similar number of positive charges in film materials forming dipoles with the F4TCNQ radical counteranions. The effect of electron acceptors such as 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane and tetracyanoethylene was compared to that of F4TCNQ in terms of Vth shift using our analytical tool, with differences attributed to acceptor size and reduction potential. Meanwhile, this FET analysis tool offered a means of monitoring the physical diffusion of small molecules, exemplified by F4TCNQ, in the passive polymer polystyrene, driven by concentration gradients. The technique allows for nondestructive, nonspectroscopic, ambient characterization of electron donor-acceptor interactions at surfaces.
