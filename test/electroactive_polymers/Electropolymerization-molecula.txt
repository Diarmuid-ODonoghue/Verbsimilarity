A novel chemosensitive ultrathin film with high selectivity was developed for the detection of naproxen, paracetamol, and theophylline using non-covalent electropolymerized molecular imprinted polymers (E-MIP). A series of monofunctional and bifunctional H-bonding terthiophene and carbazole monomers were compared for imprinting these drugs without the use of a separate cross-linker. A key step is the fast and efficient potentiostatic method of washing the template, which facilitated enhanced real-time sensing by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. Various surface characterizations (contact angle, ellipsometry, XPS, AFM) of the E-MIP film verified the templating and release of the drug from the cross-linked conducting polymer film.
