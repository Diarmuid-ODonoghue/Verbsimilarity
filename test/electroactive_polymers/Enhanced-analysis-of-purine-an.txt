A double-strand polymeric complex, which suppresses electroosmotic flow relative to fused-silica, is described. The polymeric complex contains a strand polyaniline (PAN) with the second strand containing polyacrylic acid (PAA) and methacrylate (MA) groups. The complex is referred to as PAN:P(AAMA). This polymeric complex has pH-controlled electroactive and hydrophobic characteristics and can be easily coated onto fused-silica. Enhanced separations of theophylline, theobromine, caffeine and adenine, thymine, uracil and cytosine were obtained by the use of the coated capillary in the micellar electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis (MEKC) system. The purine and pyrimdine bases were separated on the coated capillary with a 20 mM, pH 7 phosphate buffer which contains 0.05 M sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as an additive.
