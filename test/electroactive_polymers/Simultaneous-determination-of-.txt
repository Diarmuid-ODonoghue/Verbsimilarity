We explored the use of carbon black (CB), graphene oxide (GO), copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as electrode materials for the simultaneous determination of isoproterenol, acetaminophen, folic acid, propranolol and caffeine. The designed nanostructured surface was widely characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), contact angle measurements and electrochemistry. From electrochemical characterization assays carried out towards the potassium ferricyanide redox probe, fast electron transfer kinetics and a considerably higher electroactive surface area were observed for the modified electrodic surface based on CB, GO, CuNPs and PEDOT:PSS film. Using square-wave voltammetry (SWV), well defined and resolved anodic peaks were detected for isoproterenol, acetaminophen, folic acid, propranolol and caffeine, with peak-to-peak potential separation not less than 170â€¯mV. Then, the SWV technique was explored for the simultaneous determination of quinary mixtures of these analytes, resulting in analytical curves with linear ranges and limits of detection at micromolar concentration levels. The practical viability of the proposed voltammetric sensor was illustrated in the analysis of human body fluid samples. The proposed sensor showed good repeatability and a successful application using urine and serum matrices, with recoveries close to 100%.
