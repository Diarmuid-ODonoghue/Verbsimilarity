In this paper, the films of overoxidized polypyrrole (PPyox) directed single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been electrochemically coated onto glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Electroactive monomer pyrrole was added into the solution containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and SWNTs. Then, electropolymerization was proceeded at the surface of GCE, and a novel kind of conducting polymer/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite film with the orientation of CNTs were obtained correspondingly. Finally, this obtained polypyrrole (PPy)/SWNTs film modified GCE was oxidized at a potential of +1.8 V. It can be found that this proposed PPyox/SWNTs composite film modified GCE exhibited excellent electrocatalytic properties for some species such as nitrite, ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA), and could be used as a new sensor for practical applications. Compared with previous CNTs modified electrodes, SWNTs were oriented towards the outside of modified layer by PPyox and SDS, which made the film easily conductive. Moreover, this proposed film modified electrode was more stable, selective and applicable.
