The construction and characteristic performance of metoclopramide (MCP)-polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane sensor are described. The sensor is based on the use of MCP-tetraiodomercurate ion pair as electroactive material in PVC matrix in presence of dioctylphthalate (DOP) as solvent mediator. MCP membrane sensor shows a stable, near Nernstian response over the concentration range 1 x 10(-2)-6 x 10(-5) M of MCP at 25 degrees C in the pH range 3-7 with cationic slope of 53.0+/-0.5. The detection limit of 4 x 10(-5) M and the response time of 30-60 s have been attained. Selectivity coefficient data for some common ions show negligible intereferences. Direct potentiometric determination of 15-3540 microg/ml MCP show an average recovery of 98.5% and a mean relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 1.6% at 100.0 microg/ml. The determination of MCP in Primperan tablets, injection, and syrup gave results that compare favorably with those obtained by the British pharmacopoeia method. Precipitation titrations involving MCP as titrant are monitored with the MCP sensor for some potentiometric precipitation reaction, e.g. sodium tetraphenylborate (STPB) and phosphomolybdic acid (PMA).
