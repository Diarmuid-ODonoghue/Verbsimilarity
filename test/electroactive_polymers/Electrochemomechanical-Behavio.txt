Glucose-gelatin nanofiber scaffolds were made conductive and electroactive by chemical (conductive fiber scaffolds, CFS) and additionally electrochemical polypyrrole deposition (doped with triflouromethanesulfonate CF3SO3-, CFS-PPyTF). Both materials were investigated in their linear actuation properties in cell culture medium (CCM), as they could be potential electro-mechanically activated cell growth substrates. Independent of the deposition conditions, both materials showed relatively stable cation-driven actuation in CCM, based on the flux of mainly Na+ ions from CCM. The surprising result was attributed to re-doping by sulfate anions in CCM, as also indicated by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy results. Overall, the electrochemically coated material outperformed the one with just chemical coating in conductivity, charge density and actuation response.
