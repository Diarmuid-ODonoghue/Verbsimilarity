This paper describes potentiometric measurements in an integrated galvanic cell with both indicator and reference electrodes. Both electrodes are conducting polymer-based. The copper-sensitive indicator electrode is made by using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with 2-(o-arsenophenylazo)-1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulphonic sodium salt (Arsenazo-I) as the electroactive substance in the film, while the reference electrode is based on PEDOT doped by 2-morpholineoethanesulfonic acid (MES). It is shown that the galvanic cell can be used for determination of copper both in non-aqueous media (where all PVC-based membranes failed) and in the presence of chloride ions, which disturb the signal of conventional copper ion-selective electrodes with solid-state membranes. It is further shown that the titration of copper ions can be successfully monitored using the described electrochemical cell.
