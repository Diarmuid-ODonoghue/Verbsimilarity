A series of novel polyurethane/siloxane-based wound dressing membranes was prepared through sol-gel reaction of methoxysilane end-functionalized urethane prepolymers composed of castor oil and ricinoleic methyl ester as well as methoxysilane functional aniline tetramer (AT) moieties. The samples were fully characterized and their physicochemical, mechanical, electrical, and biological properties were assayed. The biological activity of these dressings against fibroblast cells and couple of microbes was also studied. It was revealed that samples that displayed electroactivity by introduction of AT moieties showed a broad range of antimicrobial activity toward different microorganisms, promising antioxidant (radical scavenging) efficiency and significant activity for stimulation of fibroblast cell growth and proliferation. Meanwhile, these samples showed appropriate tensile strength and ability for maintaining a moist environment over a wound by controlled equilibrium water absorption and water vapor transmission rate. The selected electroactive dressing was subjected to an in vivo assay using a rat animal model and the wound healing process was monitored and compared with analogous dressing without AT moieties. The recorded results showed that the electroactive dressings induced an increase in the rate of wound contraction, promoted collagen deposition, and encouraged vascularization in the wounded area. On the basis of the results of in vitro and in vivo assays, the positive influence of designed dressings for accelerated healing of a wound model was confirmed.
