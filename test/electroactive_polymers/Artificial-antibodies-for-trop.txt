A novel artificial antibody for troponin T (TnT) was synthesized by molecular imprint (MI) on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). This was done by attaching TnT to the MWCNT surface, and filling the vacant spaces by polymerizing under mild conditions acrylamide (monomer) in N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (cross-linker) and ammonium persulphate (initiator). After removing the template, the obtained biomaterial was able to rebind TnT and discriminate it among other interfering species. Stereochemical recognition of TnT was confirmed by the non-rebinding ability displayed by non-imprinted (NI) materials, obtained by imprinting without a template. SEM and FTIR analysis confirmed the surface modification of the MWCNT. The ability of this biomaterial to rebind TnT was confirmed by including it as electroactive compound in a PVC/plasticizer mixture coating a wire of silver, gold or titanium. Anionic slopes of 50 mV decade(-1) were obtained for the gold wire coated with MI-based membranes dipped in HEPES buffer of pH 7. The limit of detection was 0.16 Î¼g mL(-1). Neither the NI-MWCNT nor the MWCNT showed the ability to recognize the template. Good selectivity was observed against creatinine, sucrose, fructose, myoglobin, sodium glutamate, thiamine and urea. The sensor was tested successfully on serum samples. It is expected that this work opens new horizons on the design of new artificial antibodies for complex protein structures.
