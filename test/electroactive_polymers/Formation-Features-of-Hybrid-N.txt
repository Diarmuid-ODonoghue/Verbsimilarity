Hybrid nanocomposites based on electroactive polydiphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (PDPAC) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were obtained for the first time. Polymer-carbon nanomaterials were synthesized via in situ oxidative polymerization of diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPAC) in the presence of SWCNTs by two different ways. Hybrid SWCNT/PDPAC nanocomposites were prepared both in an acidic medium and in the heterophase system in an alkaline medium. In the heterophase system, the monomer and the SWCNTs are in the organic phase (chloroform) and the oxidant (ammonium persulfate) is in an aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide. The chemical structure, as well as the electrical and thermal properties of the developed SWCNT/PDPAC nanocomposite materials were investigated.
