A novel electrochemical sensor with inherent redox activity mediated by ferrocene for Cystatin C (CysC), an early kidney failure biomarker, is described. The current response was mediated by graphene oxide-ferrocene nanofilm with redox-activity coming from electroactive species surface-confined. Anti-CysC antibodies were immobilized by their Fc portions on the drop-casting polyethyleneimine (PEI) film for improving the sensitivity and reproducibility. Stepwise modifications of the nanostructured surface were characterized by electrochemical techniques, FT-IR and AFM. FT-IR confirmed the formation of the Fc-GO nanocomposite and PEI deposition on the electrode surface. The AFM micrographs confirmed a nanometric film of Fc-GO and PEI. The sensor platform showed a response from 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL and lower limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03 ng/mL of CysC, with good accuracy, specificity and it was successfully applied for CysC detection. Advantages of this immunosensor include rapid testing with minimal steps by the simple use of an intrinsic redox probe, working in a reduction potential, which avoids potential interferences. This proposal attempts to circumvent amperometric detection limitations and provides a promising candidate for future point-of-care diagnostics without redox probe additional solutions for measurements.
