A novel potentiometric zirconium--PVC matrix membrane sensor incorporating bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene as an electroactive material and tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate as solvent mediator is described. In mixed acetate buffer solution of pH 4.8, the sensor displays a rapid and linear response for zirconium ion over the concentration range 1.0 x 10(-1) to 1.0 x 10(-7) mol L(-1) with a good slope of 59.7+/-0.3 mV per decade and detection limit 1.8 x 10(-8) mol L(-1). The best performance was obtained with membrane composition 33% PVC, 65% TEHP, 1% NaTPB and 1% ionophore. The proposed electrode revealed excellent selectivity for zirconium ion over a wide variety of alkali, alkaline earth, transition and heavy metal ions and could be used in a pH range of 4.15-7.8. The electrode was applied for at least 1 month without any considerable divergence in the potential responses. The practical utility of the electrode has been demonstrated by its use as an indicator electrode in the potentiometric titration of zirconium ions with sodium fluoride and in determination of zirconium ion in some alloy, tape and waste water samples.
