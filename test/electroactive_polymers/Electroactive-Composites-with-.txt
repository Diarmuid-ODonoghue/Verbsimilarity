Cancer has been one of the leading causes of human death for centuries. Magnetic hyperthermia is a promising technique to confine and control cancers. However, particles used in magnetic hyperthermia leaking from where the cancers are located could compromise human health. Therefore, we developed electroactive iron oxide/block copolymer composites to tackle the leakage problem. Experimental results show that oleylamine-modified magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) particles and electroactive tetraaniline (TA) could be templated in the self-assembled microstructures of sulfonated [styrene-b-(ethylene-ran-butylene)-b-styrene] (S-SEBS) block copolymers. Various amounts of Fe3O4 particles and TA oligomer were incorporated in S-SEBS block copolymer and their electroactive behavior was confirmed by exhibiting two pairs of well-defined anodic and cathodic current peaks in cyclic voltammetry tests. The heating performance of the resultant TA/Fe3O4/polymer composites improved on increasing the added amount of Fe3O4 particles and TA oligomers. Both Fe3O4 and TA can contribute to improved heating performance, but Fe3O4 possesses a greater contribution than TA does. Hence, the main source for increasing the composites' temperature is Neel relaxation loss from Fe3O4 magnetic particles.
