Implantable devices for long-lasting controlled insulin microinjection are of great value to diabetic patients. To address this need, we develop a flexible electroactive pump based on a biocompatible polypyrrole composite film that comprises a polypyrrole matrix and a macromolecular dopant of polycaprolactone-block-polytetrahydrofuran-block-polycaprolactone. Using phosphate-buffered saline as the electrolyte, this film demonstrates much higher electroactivity and reproducibility than conventional Cl--doped polypyrrole, making it an excellent actuator for driving an implantable pump. At a driving current density of 1 mA/cm2, the pump demonstrates a consistent output capacity of 10.5 at 0.35 Î¼L/s over 20 cycles. This work paves the way for the development of an implantable electroactive pump to improve the quality of life of diabetics.
