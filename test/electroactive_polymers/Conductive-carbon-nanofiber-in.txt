Long-term stability and high-rate capability have been the major challenges of sodium-ion batteries. Layered electroactive materials with mechanically robust, chemically stable, electrically and ironically conductive networks can effectively address these issues. Herein we have successfully directed carbon nanofibers to vertically penetrate through graphene sheets, constructing robust carbon nanofiber interpenetrated graphene architecture. Molybdenum disulfide nanoflakes are then grown in situ alongside the entire framework, yielding molybdenum disulfide@carbon nanofiber interpenetrated graphene structure. In such a design, carbon nanofibers prevent the restacking of graphene sheets and provide ample space between graphene sheets, enabling a strong structure that maintains exceptional mechanical integrity and excellent electrical conductivity. The as-prepared sodium ion battery delivers outstanding electrochemical performance and ultrahigh stability, achieving a remarkable specific capacity of 598 mAh g-1, long-term cycling stability up to 1000 cycles, and an excellent rate performance even at a high current density up to 10 A g-1.
