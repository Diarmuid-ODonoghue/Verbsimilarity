Polymer-metal-carbon hybrid nanomaterials based on thermostable electroactive poly-3-amine-7-methylamine-2-methylphenazine (PAMMP), single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and magnetite (Fe₃O₄) nanoparticles were synthesized for the first time. Hybrid Fe₃O₄/SWCNT/PAMMP nanomaterial synthesis was carried out via in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of 3-amine-7-methylamine-2-methylphenazine hydrochloride in the presence of metal-carbon Fe₃O₄/SWCNT nanocomposites. Fe₃O₄/SWCNT nanocomposites were obtained by the immobilization of magnetite nanoparticles on the SWCNT surface in the course of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles synthesis in alkaline medium. The developed nanocomposite materials were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission (FE-SEM) scanning electron microscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and magnetometry. The chemical structure and phase composition, magnetic and electrical properties, and thermal stability of the obtained multifunctional nanomaterials, depending on synthesis conditions, were investigated.
