In this work, an electroactive porous Mb-CA's composite film was fabricated by incorporating myoglobin (Mb) in a three-dimension (3D) porous calcium alginate (CA) film with polyvinyl alcohol, glycerol, and gelatin. The porous Mb-CA's film modified electrodes exhibited a pair of well-defined, quasi-reversible cyclic voltammetric (CV) peaks at about -0.37 V vs. SCE in pH 7.0 buffers, characteristic of Mb heme Fe((III))/Fe((II)) redox couples. The electrochemical parameters, such as formal potentials (E(o')) and apparent heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constants (ks), were estimated by square-wave voltammetry with nonlinear regression analysis. The porous CA's composite film could form hydrogel in aqueous solution. The positions of the Soret absorbance band suggest that Mb in the CA's composite film kept its native states in the medium pH range. Hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, and nitrite were electrochemically catalyzed by the Mb-CA's composite film with significant lowering of the reduction overpotential.
