Herein, we report a facile enzyme-free microRNA (miRNA) target-triggered strand displacement reaction (SDR) amplification strategy with ferrocene (Fc) as a signal molecule to fabricate a two-dimensional electroactive molybdenum carbide (Mo2C)-based biosensor. In the presence of miRNA-21, SDR was initiated and many hairpin DNA1 (HDNA1) and hairpin DNA2 (HDNA2) duplexes, which could be captured by probe DNA leading the Fc-modified HDNA2 close to the electrode surface, were produced continuously. MiRNA-21 could be detected by monitoring the redox signal of Fc. The prepared N-carboxymethyl chitosan/Mo2C nanocomposite featured excellent conductivity, great dispersion, and multiple functional groups (amine groups). When the nanocomposite was introduced to a miRNA biosensor electrode interface to ensure its strong connection to the DNA probe, the developed miRNA-21 biosensor demonstrated a reliable linear range of 1.0 fM to 1.0 nM with a detection limit of 0.34 fM and showed good selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. The biosensor was employed to detect miRNA-21 in human serum samples, and it showed great potential in the early clinical diagnosis of various genetic diseases.
