This work contextualizes the research of materials that can be applied as artificial muscles. The main motivation of this research is the importance of the development of mechatronic systems for the replacement of traditional devices of actuation and motion based on rotational electrical motors by other devices that reproduce biological muscle movements. Electroactive polymers (EAPs) are materials that respond to electric stimuli with shape and/or dimension changes, and accomplish movements that are smooth enough to mimic biological muscles. Among EAPs, the ionomeric polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) are an interesting alternative to biomimetic devices due to large displacements when submitted to low applied voltage. This article presents a brief review of IPMCs, a sample preparation procedure, and some electromechanical experimental results. We also discuss the applicability of this technology in medical devices and as artificial muscles.
