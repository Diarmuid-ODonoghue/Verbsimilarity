In the present paper, we describe a microfluidics-based sensing system for nonelectroactive anions under negative separation electric field by mounting a single carbon fiber disk working electrode (WE) in the end part of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) microchannel. In contrast to work in a positive separation electric field described in our previous paper (Anal. Chem. 2004, 76, 6902-6907), here the electrochemical reduction reaction at the WE is not coupled with the separation high-voltage (HV) system, whereas the electrochemical oxidation reaction at the WE is coupled with the separation HV system. The electroactive indicator is the carbon fiber WE itself but not dissolved oxygen. This provides a convenient and sensitive means for the determination of nonelectroactive anions by amperometry. The influences of separation voltage, detection potential, and the distance between the WE and the separation channel outlet on the response of the detector have been investigated. The present detection mode is successfully used to electrochemically detect F-, Cl-, SO4(2-), CH3COO-, H2PO4-. Based on the preliminary results, a detection limit of 2 microM and a dynamic range up to three orders of magnitude for Cl- could be achieved.
