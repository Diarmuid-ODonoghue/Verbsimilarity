In this study, poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) was synthesized using the epsilon-caprolactone (CL) monomer ring-opening polymerization. We demonstrated that the hemoglobin (Hb) entrapped in PCL film could retain its original conformation by FT-IR spectra. A pair of well-defined redox peaks with a formal potential (E0') of about -0.38V (vs. SCE) in a pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution was obtained at the Hb-PCL film modified GC electrode. The dependence of E(0') on the pH of the buffer solution indicated that the conversion of heme Fe(III)/Fe(II) was a reaction of one electron coupled to one proton. The apparent heterogeneous electron transfer rate constants (ks) of Hb confined to PCL was valuated as (18.7+/-0.8)s(-1) according to Laviron's equation. The surface concentration (Gamma*) of the electroactive Hb in the PCL film was estimated to be (7.27+/-0.57)x10(-11)molcm(-2). The Hb-PCL film modified electrode was shown to be an excellent amperometric sensor for the detection of hydrogen peroxide. The linear range is from 2 to 30microM with a detection limit of 6.07x10(-6)M. The sensor was effectively testified by the determination of the hydrogen peroxide in eyedrops as real samples.
