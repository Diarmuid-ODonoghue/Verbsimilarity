To prepare one electroactive and biodegradable biomaterial for biomedical application, a new synthetic strategy was developed to synthesize a novel electrically conductive biodegradable polyphosphazene polymer containing parent aniline pentamer (PAP) and glycine ethyl ester (GEE) as side chains by a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The electrical conductivity of the polymer is approximately 2 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) in the semiconducting region upon preliminarily protonic-doped experiment. The degradation and RSC96 Schwann cells experiments in vitro prove that the polymer is biodegradable and beneficial to the cell adhesion and proliferation. The as-synthesized polymer also shows good solubility in common organic solvent and good film-forming properties. This new type of polymer has potential applications as scaffolds for neuronal and cardiovascular tissue engineering or other biomedical devices that require electroactivity.
