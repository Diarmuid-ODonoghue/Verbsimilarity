New coated platinum selective electrodes have been prepared and used for the determination of oseltamivir phosphate (OSL) in bulk drug solutions and in pharmaceutical preparations. Electrodes were using plasticized PVC membranes doped with ion-pair complexes based on drug-phosphomolybdate and drug-tetraphenylborate as electroactive materials. The influence of membrane composition (plasticizers and ion-pair complexes) has been investigated. Optimum performance was obtained for two polymeric membranes: PVC:o-NPPE:OSL-TPB in the ratio of 30:68:2 (%, w:w:w) and PVC:DPP:OSL-PMA in the ratio of 30:68:2 (%, w:w:w). The electrodes exhibited linear responses over large concentration ranges (1.0×10(-5)-1.0×10(-2) and 5.0×10(-5)-5.0×10(-2)M, respectively) with near-Nernstian responses (58.9 and 57.3mV/decade, respectively). The selectivity coefficients indicated good selectivity for OSL drug over a large number of organic compounds and some inorganic cations. The proposed electrodes were successfully applied to the determination of OSL in raw material and in pharmaceutical formulations. The results were validated by comparison with a capillary electrophoresis method.
