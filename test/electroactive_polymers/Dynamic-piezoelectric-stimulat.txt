This work reports on the influence of the substrate polarization of electroactive β-poly(vinylidene fluoride) (β-PVDF) on human adipose stem cells (hASCs) differentiation under static and dynamic conditions. hASCs were cultured on different β-PVDF surfaces (non-poled and "poled -") adsorbed with fibronectin and osteogenic differentiation was determined using a quantitative alkaline phosphatase assay. "Poled -" β-PVDF samples promote higher osteogenic differentiation, which is even higher under dynamic conditions. It is thus demonstrated that electroactive membranes can provide the necessary electromechanical stimuli for the differentiation of specific cells and therefore will support the design of suitable tissue engineering strategies, such as bone tissue engineering.
