Protein multilayers, consisting of cytochrome c (cyt c) and poly(aniline sulfonic acid) (PASA), are investigated by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (E-QCM-D). This technique reveals that a four-bilayer assembly has rather rigid properties. A thickness of 16.3 ± 0.8 nm is calculated with the Sauerbrey equation and is found to be in good agreement with a viscoelastic model. The electroactive amount of cyt c is estimated by the deposited mass under the assumption of 50% coupled water. Temperature-induced stabilization of the multilayer assembly has been investigated in the temperature range between 30 and 45 °C. The treatment results in a loss of material and a contraction of the film. The electroactive amount of cyt c also decreases during heating and remains constant after the cooling period. The contraction of the film is accompanied by the enhanced stability of the assembly. In addition, it is found that cyt c and PASA can be assembled at higher temperatures, resulting in the formation of multilayer systems with less dissipation.
