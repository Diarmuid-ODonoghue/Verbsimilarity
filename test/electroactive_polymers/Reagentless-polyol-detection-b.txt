We report on the novel reagentless and label-free detection principle based on electroactive (conducting) polymers considering sensors for polyols, particularly, saccharides and hydroxy acids. Unlike the majority of impedimetric and conductometric (bio)sensors, which specific and unspecific signals are directed in the same way (resistance increase), making doubtful their real applications, the response of the reported system results in resistance decrease, which is directed oppositely to the background. The mechanism of the resistance decrease is the polyaniline self-doping, i.e., as an alternative to proton doping, an appearance of the negatively charged aromatic ring substituents in polymer chain. Negative charge "freezing" at the boron atom is indeed a result of complex formation with di- and polyols, specific binding. Changes in Raman spectra of boronate-substituted polyaniline after addition of glucose are similar to those caused by proton doping of the polymer. Thermodynamic data on interaction of the electropolymerized 3-aminophenylboronic acid with saccharides and hydroxy acids also confirm that the observed resistance decrease is due to polymer interaction with polyols. The first reported conductivity increase as a specific signal opens new horizons for reagentless affinity sensors, allowing the discrimination of specific affinity bindings from nonspecific interactions.
