Ionic electroactive polymers (IEAPs) have received considerable attention for their flexibility, lightweight composition, large displacement, and low-voltage activation. Recently, many metal-nonmetal composite electrodes have been actively studied. Specifically, graphene oxide-silver nanowire (GO-Ag NW) composite electrodes offer advantages among IEAPs with metal-nonmetal composite electrodes. However, GO-Ag NW composite electrodes still show a decrease in displacement owing to low stability and durability during driving. Therefore, the durability and stability of the IEAPs with metal-nonmetal composite electrodes must be improved. One way to improve the device durability is coating the electrode surface with a protective layer. This layer must have enough flexibility and suitable electrical properties such that it does not hinder the IEAPs' driving. Herein, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) protective layer and 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenyl-polyethylene glycol (Triton X-100) are applied to improve driving performance. Triton X-100 is a nonionic surfactant that transforms the PEDOT:PSS capsule into a nanofibril structure. In this study, a mixed Triton X-100/PEDOT:PSS protective layer at an optimum weight ratio was coated onto the GO-Ag NW composite-electrode-based IEAPs under various conditions. The IEAP actuators based on GO-Ag NW composite electrodes with a protective layer of PEDOT:PSS treated with Triton X-100 showed the best stability and durability.
