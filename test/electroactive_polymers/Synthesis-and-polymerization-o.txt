Sulfonated polymers have found use as ion-exchange membranes for use in fuel cells, water purification, electroactive devices, and inorganic materials templating and synthesis. Improving the materials for these applications and opening up new applications requires the ability to synthesis targeted or more complex sulfonated polymers, which includes tailoring the chemistry (copolymerization across a wider range of solubility) and/or polymer architecture (block, graft, nanoparticle). This article will summarize the recent work using sulfonated monomers with substituted ammonium counterions as a versatile route for enabling this goal. Two main benefits of these monomers are as follows. First, they are useful for preparing amphiphilic copolymers, which is a challenge using traditional acidic or alkali salt forms of sulfonated monomers. Second, sulfonated polymers with substituted ammonium counterions are useful polymers for obtaining unique material properties, such as organo-gelation of low polarity solvents or obtaining ionic liquid polymers for the fabrication of solid polymer electrolytes.
