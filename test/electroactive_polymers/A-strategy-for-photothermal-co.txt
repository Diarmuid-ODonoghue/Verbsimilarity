The near-infrared (NIR)-mediated novel strategy to control the drug release from nanocarriers has developed rapidly in recent decades. Polyaniline as a non-cytotoxic and electroactive material for studying cellular proliferation has attracted great attention in recent years. In the present work, polyaniline-mediated polymeric nanoparticles were developed to target the delivery of cisplatin and release it in a controllable way. The prepared polyaniline nanoparticles displayed a size of 90 ± 1.0 nm, a favorable morphology in water, and could be targeted to tumors through the high affinity between trastuzumab and the overexpressed Her2 in tumor cells. In addition, the developed nanoparticles demonstrated exciting photothermal conversion efficiency induced by NIR light and achieved significant cell inhibition efficiency (93.97%) in vitro when exposed to an 808 nm NIR laser with the power of 1.54 W for 5 min. Therefore, the developed external control release delivery system with excellent specificity and high cytotoxicity exhibited great potential in cell research and our research demonstrated that the polyaniline also has potential in the application of photothermal conversion in biomedicine.
