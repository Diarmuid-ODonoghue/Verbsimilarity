Polypyrrole (PPy) was electropolymerized in xanthan hydrogels (XCA), resulting in electroactive XCAPPy scaffolds with (15 ± 3) wt.% PPy and (40 ± 10) μm thick. The physicochemical characterization of hybrid XCAPPy scaffolds was performed by means of cyclic voltammetry, swelling tests, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and tensile tests. XCAPPy swelled~80% less than XCA. FTIR spectra and thermal analyses did not evidence strong interaction between PPy and XCA matrix. XCAPPy presented a porous stratified structure resulting from the arrangement of PPy chains parallel to XCA surface. Under stress XCAPPy presented larger strain than neat XCA probably due to the sliding of planar PPy chains. The adhesion and proliferation of fibroblasts onto XCA and XCAPPy were evaluated in the absence and in the presence of external magnetic field (EMF) of 0.4T, after one day, 7 days, 14 days and 21 days. Fibroblast proliferation was more pronounced onto XCAPPy than onto XCA, due to its higher hydrophobicity and surface roughness. EMF stimulated cell proliferation onto both scaffolds.
