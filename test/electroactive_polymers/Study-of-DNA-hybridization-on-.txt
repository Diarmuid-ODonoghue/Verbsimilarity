Recognition of DNA sequences by biochemical sensor is generally performed by analysis after completion of hybridization. Using a technique able to directly translate the biological event into an electrical signal allows the in situ monitoring of the hybridization kinetics. In this aim, the photoelectrochemical behavior of one electroactive polymeric sensor based on a copolymer of polypyrrole and polypyrrole-oligonucleotide has been investigated in aqueous solution. This sensor has been studied as such (i) and in two other situations: (ii) when the copolymer is in presence of non-complementary oligonucleotides; and (iii) when the copolymer is in presence of complementary oligonucleotides. From the photocurrent spectra obtained at -0.6 V/SCE versus incident energy the allowed direct and indirect transitions for each polymer have been evidenced. The photocurrent evolution during hybridization and adsorption processes has been recorded in real time and the hybridization kinetics has revealed to be comparable with mass variations obtained by quartz crystal microbalance under the same experimental conditions.
