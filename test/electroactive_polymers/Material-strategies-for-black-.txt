Black-to-transmissive switching polymer electrochromic devices (ECDs) were designed using a set of spray-processable cathodically coloring polymers, a non-color-changing electroactive polymer poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) as the charge-compensating counter electrode, and a highly conducting gel electrolyte (6.5 mS cm(-1)). The color "black" was obtained by utilizing (1) individual copolymers absorbing across the visible spectrum, and (2) blends and bilayers of several polymer electrochromes with complementary spectral absorption. Neutral-state black and ink-like dark purple-blue (or "ink-black") donor-acceptor (DA) copolymers composed of the electron-donor 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) and the electron-acceptor 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) building units, which possess relatively homogeneous absorption profiles across the visible spectrum, were chosen for their propensity to switch to transmissive states upon electrochemical oxidation. A blend of magenta and cyan polymers (PProDOT-(CH(2)OEtHx)(2) and P(ProDOT-BTD-ProDOT), respectively) was produced with the goal of generating the same dark purple-blue color as that obtained with the "ink-black" DA copolymer. While the multi-polymer ECDs demonstrate high contrasts (up to 50%T), and switch from a saturated purple-blue color (L*=32, a*=13, b*=-46) to a light green-blue transmissive state (L*=83, a*=-3, b*=-6), devices made with the DA electrochromic copolymers switch more than two times faster (0.7 s to attain 95% of the full optical change) than those involving the polymer blends (1.6 s), and exhibit more neutral achromatic colors (L*=38, a*=5, b*=-25 for the colored state and L*=87, a*=-3, b*=-2 for the bleached state, correspondingly). The results obtained suggest that these materials should prove to be applicable in both transmissive- (window-type) and reflective-type ECDs.
