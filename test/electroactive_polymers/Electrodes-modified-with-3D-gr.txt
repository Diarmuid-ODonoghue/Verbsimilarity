Three-dimensional (3D) porous networks of planar 2D graphene have attractive features with respect to sensing. These include a large electroactive surface area, good inner and outer surface contact with the analyte, ease of loading with (bio)catalysts, and good electrochemical sensitivity. 3D free-standing graphene can even be used directly as an electrode. This review (with 140 refs.) covers the progress made in the past years. Following an introduction into the field (including definitions), a large section is presented that covers methods for the synthesis of 3D graphene (3DG) (including chemical vapor deposition, hydrothermal methods, lithography, support assisted synthesis and chemical deposition, and direct electrochemical methods). The nextÂ section covers the key features of 3DG and its composites for use in electrochemical sensors. This section is subdivided into sections on the uses of 3D porous graphene, 3DG composites with metals and metal oxides, composites consisting of 3DG and organic polymers, and electrodes modified with 3DG, 3DGs decorated with carbon nanotubes, and others. The review concludes with a discussion of future perspectives and current challenges. Graphical Abstract A schematic of the key characteristics of three-dimensional (3D) graphene.
