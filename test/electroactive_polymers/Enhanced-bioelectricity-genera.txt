A novel anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate/MnOx-doped polypyrrole film (AQDS/Mn/PPy) electrode was prepared by one-step electropolymerization method and was used to improve performance of a reversible photo-bioelectrochemical cell (RPBEC). The RPBEC was operated in polarity reversion depended on dark/light reaction of alga Chlorella vulgaris by which sequential decolorization of azo dye and mineralization of decolorization products coupled with bioelectricity generation can be achieved. The results showed that formation of uniform AQDS/Mn/PPy film significantly enhanced electroactive surface area and electrocatalytic activity of carbon electrode. The RPBEC with AQDS/Mn/PPy electrodes demonstrated 77% increases in maximum power and 73% increases in Congo red decolorization rate before polarity reversion, and 198% increases in maximum power and 138% increases in decolorization products mineralization rate after polarity reversion, respectively, compared to the RPBEC with bare electrode. This was resulted from simultaneous dynamics improvement in half-reaction rate of anode and photo-biocathode due to enhanced electron transfer and algal-bacterial biofilm formation.
