Smart surfaces, surfaces that respond to an external stimulus in a defined manner, hold considerable potential as components in molecular-based devices, not least as discrete switching elements. Many stimuli can be used to switch surfaces between different states, including redox, light, pH, and ion triggers. The present review focuses on molecular switching through the electronic excitation of molecules on surfaces with light. In developing light-responsive surfaces, investigators face several challenges, not only in achieving high photostationary states and fully reversible switching, but also in dealing with fatigue resistance and the effect of immobilization itself on molecular properties. The immobilization of light-responsive molecules requires the design and synthesis of functional molecular components both to achieve light switching and to anchor the molecular entity onto a surface. This review discusses several demonstrative examples of photoswitchable molecular systems in which the photochemistry has been explored in the immobilized state under ambient conditions and especially on electroactive surfaces, including self-assembled monolayers, bilayers, and polymer films.
