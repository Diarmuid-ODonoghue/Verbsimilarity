By means of molecular imprinting of a conducting polymer, molecular cavities selective for oxytocin nonapeptide, an autism biomarker, were designed. Embedding of the oxytocin template, and then its extracting from the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was confirmed by the XPS analysis. AFM imaging of the MIP film surface indicated changes in mechanical properties of the film after template extraction. The MIP synthetic receptor was deposited by potentiodynamic electropolymerization as a thin film on an Au film electrode in an electrochemical miniaturized microfluidic cell. The use of this cell allowed to shorten analysis time and to decrease the sample volume. The linear dynamic concentration range extended from 0.06 to 1mM with the limit of detection of 60ÂµM (S/N = 3). Advantageously, sensitivity of the diagnostic microfluidic platform devised for oxytocin determination in both synthetic serum samples and in aqueous solutions was similar and, moreover, it was selective to common interferences, such as oxytocin analogs and potential metabolites.
