Electroactive metallocene polymers are of interest due to the possibility that they offer a muscle-like response, and in gel systems very large volume changes are possible. The ferrocenyl moiety exhibits physical and electrochemical stability of the neutral and oxidized forms and could be a candidate for use as the redox-active group in these materials. The title compounds, [Fe(C5H5)(C10H11O2)], (I), and [Fe(C10H11O2)2], (II), comprise a typical ferrocene core with coplanar and approximately eclipsed cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings. In (I), there is a single methyl methacrylate substituent, with the other Cp ring unsubstituted. In (II), a methyl methacrylate substituent on each Cp ring completes the structure. In both compounds, there is an s-trans geometry of the vinyl and carbonyl components of the methacrylate group. Inversion dimers formed through C-H...O contacts dominate the crystal packing of both molecules. Weak C-H...π(ring) contacts and, in the case of (I), an unusual C-H...π(alkene) contact further stabilize the structures.
