Achieving nanoscale control over the crystalline structure and morphology of electroactive polymer films and the possibility to transfer them onto any solid substrate are important tasks for the fabrication of high-performance organic/polymeric field-effect transistors (FETs). In this work, we demonstrate that ultrathin active layers preassembled at the water/air interface can possess high, anisotropic, and substrate-independent mobility in polymer FETs. By exploiting a modified approach to the Langmuir-Schaeffer technique, we self-assemble conjugated polymers in fibrillar structures possessing controlled thickness, nanoscale structure, and morphology; these highly ordered nanofibrils can be transferred unaltered onto any arbitrary substrate. We show that FETs based on these films possess high and anisotropic hole mobility approaching 1 cm2 V-1 s-1 along the nanofibrils, being over 1 order of magnitude beyond the state-of-the-art for Langmuir-Schaefer polymer FETs. Significantly, we demonstrate that the FET performances are independent of the chemical nature and dielectric permittivity of the substrate, overcoming a critical limit in the field of polymer FETs. Our method allows the fabrication of ultrathin films for low-cost, high-performance, transparent, and flexible devices supported on any dielectric substrate.
