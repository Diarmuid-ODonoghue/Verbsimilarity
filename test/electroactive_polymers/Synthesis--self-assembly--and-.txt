We report here the synthesis and self-assembly of a series of three molecules with dendron rodcoil architecture that contain conjugated segments of oligo(thiophene), oligo(phenylene-vinylene), and oligo(phenylene). Despite their structural differences, all three molecules yield similar self-assembled structures. Electron and atomic force microscopy reveals the self-assembly of the molecules into high aspect ratio ribbon-like nanostructures which at low concentrations induce gelation in nonpolar solvent. Self-assembly results in a blue-shifted absorption spectrum and a red-shifted, quenched fluorescence spectrum, indicating aggregation of the conjugated segments within the ribbon-like structures. The assembly of these molecules into one-dimensional nanostructures is a route to pi-pi stacked supramolecular polymers for organic electronic functions. In the oligo(thiophene) derivative, self-assembly leads to a 3 orders of magnitude increase in the conductivity of iodine-doped films due to self-assembly. We also found that electric field alignment of these supramolecular assemblies can be used to create arrays of self-assembled nanowires on a device substrate.
