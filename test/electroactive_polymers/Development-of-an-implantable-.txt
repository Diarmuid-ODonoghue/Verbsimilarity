D-serine has been implicated as a brain messenger, promoting not only neuronal signalling but also synaptic plasticity. Thus, a sensitive tool for D-serine monitoring in brain is required to understand the mechanisms of D-serine release from glia cells. A biosensor for direct fixed potential amperometric monitoring of D-serine incorporating mammalian D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) immobilized on a Nafion coated poly-ortho-phenylenediamine (PPD) modified Pt-Ir disk electrode was therefore developed. The combined layers of PPD and Nafion enhanced the enzyme activity and biosensor efficiency by approximately 2-fold compared with each individual layer. A steady state response time (t(90%)) of 0.7+/-0.1s (n=8) and limit of detection 20+/-1 nM (n=8) were obtained. Cylindrical geometry showed lower sensitivity compared to disk geometry (61+/-7 microA cm(-2) mM(-1), (n=4), R(2)=0.999). Interference by ascorbic acid (AA), the main interference species in the central nervous system and other neurochemical electroactive molecules was negligible. Implantation of the electrode and microinjection of D-serine into rat brain striatal extracellular fluid demonstrated that the electrode was capable of detecting D-serine in brain tissue in vivo.
