Ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuators have received interest because of their advantageous properties, including their large displacement, high energy density, light weight, and low power consumption under a low electric field. However, they have a low blocking force under driving, and it is difficult to control the thickness of the ionic polymer membrane. In this study, an IEAP actuator is fabricated using a Nafion membrane with added multiwalled carbon nanotubes to increase the blocking force. A heat press two-step process is also developed to produce a constant and uniform membrane. The fabricated Nafion membrane with 0.2 wt% multiwalled carbon nanotubes has the largest displacement and highest blocking force. As a result, the developed heat press two-step method can be used in various polymer-casting fields, and the fabricated carbon nanotube-based IEAP actuators can serve as useful references in fields such as flexible robotics and artificial muscles.
