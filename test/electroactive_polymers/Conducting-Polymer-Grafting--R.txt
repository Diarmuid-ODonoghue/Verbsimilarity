Since the discovery of conductive polyacetylene, conductive electroactive polymers are at the focal point of technology generation and biocommunication materials. The reasons why this research never stops growing, are twofold: first, the demands from the advanced technology towards more sophistication, precision, durability, processability and cost-effectiveness; and second, the shaping of conducting polymer research in accordance with the above demand. One of the major challenges in conducting polymer research is addressing the processability issue without sacrificing the electroactive properties. Therefore, new synthetic designs and use of post-modification techniques become crucial than ever. This quest is not only advancing the field but also giving birth of new hybrid materials integrating merits of multiple functional motifs. The present review article is an attempt to discuss the recent progress in conducting polymer grafting, which is not entirely new, but relatively lesser developed area for this class of polymers to fine-tune their physicochemical properties. Apart from conventional covalent grafting techniques, non-covalent approach, which is relatively new but has worth creation potential, will also be discussed. The aim is to bring together novel molecular designs and strategies to stimulate the existing conducting polymer synthesis methodologies in order to enrich its fascinating chemistry dedicated toward real-life applications.
