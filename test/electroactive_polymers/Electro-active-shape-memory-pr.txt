One type of electroactive shape memory nanocomposite was fabricated, including cross-linked poly(ε-caprolactone) (cPCL) and conductive multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). The cross-linking reaction of the pristine poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was realized by using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as an initiator. The raw MWNTs (Raw-M) were prefunctionalized by acid-oxidation process and covalent grafting with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), respectively. Three kinds of nanocomposites containing cPCL/Raw-M, cPCL/acid-oxidation MWNTs (AO-M) and cPCL/PEG grafted MWNTs (PEG-M) were obtained, and the mechanical, electrical and shape memory properties were further investigated. The influence of in vitro degradation on their shape memory and mechanical properties was also evaluated. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was performed to estimate their biocompatibility. The results displayed that these nanocomposites could perform favorable shape memory recovery both in hot water at 55 °C and in electric field with 50 V applied voltage. In addition, compared with cPCL/Raw-M and cPCL/AO-M, cPCL/PEG-M composite possessed more favorable properties such as mechanical, biocompatible, and electroactive shape memory functions. Therefore, the nanocomposite may be potential for application as smart bioactuators in biomedical field.
