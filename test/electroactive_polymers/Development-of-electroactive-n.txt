Electroactive nanofibers based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and poly(alkoxy anilines) produced by electrospinning has been explored for biomaterials applications. The thermoplastic polyurethane is a biocompatible polymer with good mechanical properties. The production of TPU nanofibers requires the application of high voltage during electrospinning in order to prepare uniform mats due to its weak ability to elongate during the process. To overcome this limitation, a conductive polymer can be incorporated to the process, allowing generates mats without defects. In this study, poly(o-ethoxyaniline) POEA doped with dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) was blended with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) by solution method. Films were produced by casting and nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning. The effect of the POEA on morphology, distribution of diameter and cell viability of the nanofibers was evaluated. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of POEA in TPU provided to the mats a suitable morphology for cellular growth.
