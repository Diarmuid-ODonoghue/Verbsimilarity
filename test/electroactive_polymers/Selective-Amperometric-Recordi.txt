Quantitative description of ascorbate secretion at a single-cell level is of great importance in physiological studies; however, most studies on the ascorbate secretion have so far been performed through analyzing cell extracts with high performance liquid chromatography, which lacks time resolution and analytical performance on a single-cell level. This study demonstrates a single-cell amperometry with carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFEs) to selectively monitor amperometric vesicular secretion of endogenous ascorbate from a single rat adrenal chromaffin cell. The CFEs are electrochemically pretreated in a weakly basic solution (pH 9.5), and such pretreatment essentially enables the oxidation of ascorbate to occur at a relatively low potential (i.e., 0.0 V vs Ag/AgCl), and further a high selectivity for ascorbate measurement over endogenously existing electroactive species such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The selectivity is ensured by much larger amperometric response at the pretreated CFEs toward ascorbate over those toward other endogenously existing electroactive species added into the solution or ejected to the electrode with a micropuffer pipet, and by the totally suppressed current response by adding ascorbate oxidase into the cell lysate. With the pretreated CFE-based single-cell amperometry developed here, exocytosis of endogenous ascorbate of rat adrenal chromaffin cells is directly observed and ensured with the calcium ion-dependent high K+-induced secretion of endogenous ascorbate from the cells. Moreover, the quantitative information on the exocytosis of endogenous ascorbate is provided.
