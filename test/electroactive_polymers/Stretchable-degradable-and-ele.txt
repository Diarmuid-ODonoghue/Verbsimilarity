Development of flexible degradable electroactive shape memory polymers (ESMPs) with tunable switching temperature (around body temperature) for tissue engineering is still a challenge. Here we designed and synthesized a series of shape memory copolymers with electroactivity, super stretchability and tunable recovery temperature based on poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) with different molecular weight and conductive amino capped aniline trimer, and demonstrated their potential to enhance myogenic differentiation from C2C12 myoblast cells. We characterized the copolymers by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), shape memory test, tensile test and in vitro enzymatic degradation study. The electroactive biodegradable shape memory copolymers showed great elasticity, tunable recovery temperature around 37°C, and good shape memory properties. Furthermore, proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts were investigated on electroactive copolymers films, and they greatly enhanced the proliferation, myotube formation and related myogenic differentiation genes expression of C2C12 myoblasts compared to the pure PCL with molecular weight of 80,000. Our study suggests that these electroactive, highly stretchable, biodegradable shape memory polymers with tunable recovery temperature near the body temperature have great potential in skeletal muscle tissue engineering application.
