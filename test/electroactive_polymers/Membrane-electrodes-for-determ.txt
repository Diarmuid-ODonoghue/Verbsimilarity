Membrane-selective electrodes were used to determine benazepril hydrochloride (BZ) and trandolapril (TR) in their binary mixtures with hydrochlorothiazide (HZ) and verapamil (VR), respectively. This method involves construction of four water insoluble ion-association complexes: benazepril-tetraphenyl borate (BZ-TPB), benazepril-reineckate (BZ-R), trandolapril-tetraphenyl borate (TR-TPB), and trandolapril-reineckate (TR-R). These complexes were used as electroactive materials in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) matrix membrane sensors in order to determine the two aforementioned drugs in their pharmaceutical formulations and in plasma. The performance characteristics of these sensors, evaluated according to IUPAC recommendations, revealed a fast, stable, and linear response for BZ and TR. The suggested procedures were checked using laboratory-prepared mixtures and were successfully used to analyze their pharmaceutical preparations. The results obtained using the proposed method were statistically analyzed and compared with those obtained using previously reported methods.
