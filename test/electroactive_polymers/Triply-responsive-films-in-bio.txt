In this work, triply responsive films with a specific binary architecture combining layer-by-layer assembly (LbL) and hydrogel polymerization were successfully prepared. First, concanavalin A (Con A) and dextran (Dex) were assembled into {Con A/Dex}(5) LbL layers on electrode surface by the lectin-sugar biospecific interaction between them. The poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (PDEA) hydrogels with entrapped horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were then synthesized by polymerization on the surface of LbL inner layers, forming {Con A/Dex}(5)-(PDEA-HRP) films. The films demonstrated reversible pH-, thermo-, and salt-responsive on-off behavior toward electroactive probe Fe(CN)(6)(3-) in its cyclic voltammetric responses. This multiple stimuli-responsive films could be further used to realize triply switchable electrochemical reduction of H(2)O(2) catalyzed by HRP immobilized in the films and mediated by Fe(CN)(6)(3-) in solution. The responsive mechanism of the films was explored and discussed. The pH-sensitive property of the system was attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the {Con A/Dex}(5) inner layers and the probe at different pH, and the thermo- and salt-responsive behaviors should be ascribed to the structure change of PDEA hydrogels for the PDEA-HRP outermost layers under different conditions. The concept of binary architecture was also used to fabricate {Con A/Dex}(5)-(PDEA-GOD) films on electrodes, where GOD = glucose oxidase, which was applied to realize the triply switchable bioelectrocatalysis of glucose by GOD in the films with ferrocenedicarboxylic acid as the mediator in solution. This film system with the unique binary architecture may establish a foundation for fabricating a novel type of multicontrollable biosensors based on bioelectrocatalysis with immobilized enzymes.
