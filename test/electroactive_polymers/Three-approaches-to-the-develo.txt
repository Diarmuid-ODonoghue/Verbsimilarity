Three different glucose oxidase biosensors for the enzymatic determination of glucose, based on bilayer polymer coatings consisting of polypyrrole (PPy) and poly(o-phenylenediamine), were developed. The electrode substrates are Pt metal, carbon paste and an organic conducting salt (tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane), which introduces appreciable variability in the electrode construction process. The three sensors were compared with one another and with bare and PPy monolayer-coated sensors in terms of performance in the determination of glucose in a synthetic serum sample. These configurations provide improved selectivity against the interferences of electroactive species such as ascorbic acid and uric acid, frequently present in biological samples, and the differences between them can be taken advantage of in application to different kinds of samples.
