Polypyrrole/poly(vinyl sulfonate) (PPy/PVS) films in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M LiClO4 were studied by cyclic voltammetry. Consecutive voltammograms pointed to a continuous increase in the charge involved in the process, suggesting a rise in the number of the electroactive participants involved in the redox process. However, voltammograms obtained for the PPy/ClO4 films in analogous conditions pointed to a steady-state behavior from the very early cycles. Theoretical studies based on the Nernst and Butler-Volmer equations indicated that perchlorate ions are involved during the oxidation/reduction process of the PPy/PVS films when the steady state is reached. This result was confirmed by "ex situ" energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of the films. In this regard, the electrochemical behavior of PPy/PVS polymers was similar to that of PPy/ClO4 films when a high number of cycles were carried out. The exchange of ClO4- during the redox reaction of the PPy/PVS films made it necessary to incorporate Li+ cations inside the polymer during the initial voltammetric cycles to compensate for the negative charges of PVS polyanions. Li+ cations are mainly stabilized inside the polymer by the ion pairs formed with the sulfonated groups of the PVS. An increase and shift of the voltammetric cycles indicated a restructuring of the polymeric chains with consecutive scans.
