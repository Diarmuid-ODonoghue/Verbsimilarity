A novel amperometric biosensor, based on electrodeposition of platinum nanoparticles onto multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNTs) and immobilizing enzyme with chitosan-SiO(2) sol-gel, is presented in this article. MWNTs were cast on the glass carbon (GC) substrate directly. An extra Nafion coating was used to eliminate common interferents such as acetaminophen and ascorbic acids. The morphologies and electrochemical performance of the modified electrodes have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and amperometric methods, respectively. The synergistic action of Pt and MWNTs and the biocompatibility of chitosan-SiO(2) sol-gel made the biosensor have excellent electrocatalytic activity and high stability. The resulting biosensor exhibits good response performance to glucose with a wide linear range from 1 microM to 23 mM and a low detection limit 1 microM. The biosensor also shows a short response time (within 5s), and a high sensitivity (58.9 microAm M(-1)cm(-2)). In addition, effects of pH value, applied potential, rotating rate, electrode construction and electroactive interferents on the amperometric response of the sensor were investigated and discussed in detail.
