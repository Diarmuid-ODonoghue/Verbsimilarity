Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) provide a unique platform for the molecular design of electronic and optoelectronic materials. Here, the synthesis and characterization of an electroactive COF containing the well-known tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) unit is reported. The TTF-COF crystallizes into 2D sheets with an eclipsed AA stacking motif, and shows high thermal stability and permanent porosity. The presence of TTF units endows the TTF-COF with electron-donating ability, which is characterized by cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the open frameworks of TTF-COF are amenable to doping with electron acceptors (e.g., iodine), and the conductivity of TTF-COF bulk samples can be improved by doping. Our results open up a reliable route for the preparation of well-ordered conjugated TTF polymers, which hold great potential for applications in fields from molecular electronics to energy storage.
