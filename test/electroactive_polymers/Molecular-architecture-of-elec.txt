Two-, four-, and six-armed branched copolymers with electroactive and biodegradable properties were synthesized by coupling reactions between poly(l-lactides) (PLLAs) with different architecture and carboxyl-capped aniline trimer (CCAT). The aniline oligomer CCAT was prepared from amino-capped aniline trimer and succinic anhydride. FT-IR, NMR, and SEC analyses confirmed the structure of the branched copolymers. UV-vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry of CCAT and copolymer solution showed good electroactive properties, similar to those of polyaniline. The water contact angle of the PLLAs was the highest, followed by the undoped copolymer and the doped copolymers. The values of doped four-armed copolymers were 54-63 degrees . Thermal properties of the polymers were studied by DSC and TGA. The copolymers had better thermal stability than the pure PLLAs, and the T(g) between 48-58 degrees C and T(m) between 146-177 degrees C of the copolymers were lower than those of the pure PLLA counterparts. This kind of electroactive and biodegradable copolymer has a great potential for applications in cardiovascular or neuronal tissue engineering.
