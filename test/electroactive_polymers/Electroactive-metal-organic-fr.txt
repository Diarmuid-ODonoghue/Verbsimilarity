Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as molecular crystalline materials have been extensively applied in various fields such as catalysis, separation, and biomedical engineering. However, the applications of MOFs materials are limited in electrochemical biosensing due to the poor conductivity, less selectivity, and lack of modification sites. By incorporating the functionalized nanoparticles into MOF structures, MOF-based composites are endowed with high electronic conductivity and strong catalytic activity, which process the advantages over single-component MOFs. With a particular focus on the electrochemical applications of MOF composites, this review summarizes the comprehensive guidelines on design of electroactive MOF composites: dopant modification of electroactive ligands, in situ synthesis of nanoparticle@MOF composites and post-modification of MOF structure. The illustrative examples of electroactive MOF composites in the last five years are highlighted in electrochemical, electrochemiluminescent, and photoelectrochemical biosensing. The prospects and challenges for future work are also included. Understanding the structure-function relationship of electroactive MOF composites benefits the design of next-generation electrochemical biosensors.
