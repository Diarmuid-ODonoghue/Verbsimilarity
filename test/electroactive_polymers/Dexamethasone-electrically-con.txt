One of the key challenges to engineering neural interfaces is to reduce their immune response toward implanted electrodes. One potential approach to minimize or eliminate this undesired early inflammatory tissue reaction and to maintain signal transmission quality over time is the delivery of anti-inflammatory biomolecules in the vicinity of the implant. Here, we report on a facile and reproducible method for the fabrication of high surface area nanostructured electrodes coated with an electroactive polymer, polypyrrole (PPy) that can be used to precisely release drug by applying an electrical stimuli. The method consists of the electropolymerization of PPy incorporated with drug, dexamethasone (DEX), onto a brush of metallic nanopillars, obtained by electrodeposition of the metal within the nanopores of gold-coated polycarbonate template. The study of the release of DEX triggered by electrochemical stimuli indicates that the system is a true electrically controlled release system. Moreover, it appears that the presence of metallic nanowires onto the electrode surface improves the adherence between the polymer and the electrode and increases the electroactivity of the PPy coating.
