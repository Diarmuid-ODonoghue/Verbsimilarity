An improved assay for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of mutant DNA using a combination of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes, a cationic conjugated polymer (CCP) and non-ionic surfactant is reported. A comparison between CCP/surfactant and CCP alone shows enhancement in the discrimination between mutant and wild type DNA by a factor of two. A discrimination factor of 70% and 92% was calculated for single and five bases mismatched mutants, respectively when using CCP/surfactant. Furthermore, CCP/surfactant provides a strong emissive donor which increases signal to noise ratio and prevents fluctuation in the output signal caused by the suspension nature of the CCP (due to polymer aggregation) in water. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) ratio which defined as the ratio of PL emission of the acceptor to that of the donor, was found to be 20% better when the location of the mutation is five bases away from the duplex terminal compared to that in the centre of the duplex. The enhance discrimination referred to the difference in the FRET and reabsorption rates in different types of duplex. The FRET ratio can be very sensitive to the sample excitation strength, emission collection and spectrometer setting.
