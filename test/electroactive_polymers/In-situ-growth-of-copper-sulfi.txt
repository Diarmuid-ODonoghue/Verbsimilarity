A simple and facile synthetic method to incorporate copper sulfide (Cu(2)S) nanoparticles inside the mesopores of ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) is reported. The Cu(2)S/OMCs nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The results show that the incorporation of Cu(2)S nanoparticles inside the pores of OMCs does not change the highly ordered two-dimensional hexagonal mesostructure of OMCs matrix. Nonenzymatic amperometric sensor of hydrogen peroxide based on the Cu(2)S/OMCs nanocomposite modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode is developed. Compared with the pristine OMCs modified electrode, the Cu(2)S/OMCs modified electrode displays high electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen peroxide and gives linear range from 1 to 3030 microM (R=0.9986). The sensor also exhibits good ability of anti-interference to electroactive molecules. The combination of the unique properties of Cu(2)S nanoparticles and the ordered mesostructure of OMCs matrix guarantee the excellent electrocatalysis for hydrogen peroxide. The good analytical performance and low-cost make Cu(2)S/OMC nanocomposite promising for the development of effective sensor for hydrogen peroxide.
