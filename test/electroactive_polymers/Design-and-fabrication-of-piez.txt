This paper reports a fabrication method for producing piezoelectric poly (vinylidene fluoride) films in their electroactive β-phase that features controlled thickness, smooth and flat surface, and high transparency. These piezoelectric films are suitable for being used as integrated microactuators, such as piezoelectric pumps and/or mixers, in microfluidic applications. Their actuation circuit design is also reported. ATR-FTIR, UV-VIS transmittance spectroscopy and SEM techniques were used for calculating the β-phase content, for determining the transparency and for evaluating the morphology of the produced β-PVDF films, respectively. β-PVDF films with a thickness of about 25 µm were deposited by spin-coating. It was concluded that the processing parameter that mostly affect the films quality was their drying temperature. Indeed, the drying temperature of 30 °C proved to be the most suitable for obtaining non-porous and transparent films, with a β-phase content of approximately 75%.
