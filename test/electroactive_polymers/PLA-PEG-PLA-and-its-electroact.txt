Injectable hydrogels have served as biomimic scaffolds that provide a three-dimensional (3D) structure for tissue engineering or carriers for cell encapsulation in the biomedical field. In this study, the injectable electroactive hydrogels (IEHs) were prepared by introducing electrical properties into the injectable materials. Carboxyl-capped tetraaniline (CTA) as functional group was coupled with enantiomeric polylactide-poly(ethylene glycol)-polylactide (PLA-PEG-PLA), and the electroactive hydrogels were obtained by mixing the enantiomeric copolymers of CTA-PLLA-PEG-PLLA-CTA and CTA-PDLA-PEG-PDLA-CTA aqueous solutions. ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the complex solution showed good electroactive properties. The gelation mechanism and intermolecular multi-interactions such as stereocomplextion, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-vis, and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Gelation properties of the complexes were also studied by rheometer. The encapsulated cells remained highly viable in the gel matrices, suggesting that the hydrogels have excellent cytocompatibility. After subcutaneous injection, the gels were formed in situ in the subcutaneous layer, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining suggested acceptable biocompatibility of our materials in vivo. Moreover, these injectable materials, when treated with pulsed electrical stimuli, were shown to be functionally active and to accelerate the proliferation of encapsulated fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and osteoblasts. Hence, the IEHs possessing these excellent properties would be potentially used as in vivo materials for tissue engineering scaffold.
