Functionalized platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) possess electrocatalytic properties toward H2O2 oxidation, which are of great interest for the construction of electrochemical oxidoreductase-based sensors. In this context, we have shown that polymer-grafted PtNPs could efficiently be used as building bricks for electroactive structures. In the present work, we prepared different 2D-nanostructures based on these elementary bricks, followed by the subsequent grafting of enzymes. The aim was to provide well-defined architectures to establish a correlation between their electrocatalytic properties and the arrangement of building bricks. Two different nanostructures have been elaborated via the smart combination of surface initiated-atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP), functionalized PtNPs (Br-PtNPs) and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. The first nanostructure (A) has been elaborated from LB films of poly(methacrylic acid)-grafted PtNPs (PMAA-PtNPs). The second nanostructure (B) consisted in the elaboration of polymer brushes (PMAA brushes) from Br-PtNPs LB films. In both systems, grafting of the glucose oxidase (GOx) has been performed directly to nanostructures, via peptide bonding. Structural features of nanostructures have been carefully characterized (compression isotherms, neutron reflectivity, and profilometry) and correlated to their electrocatalytic properties toward H2O2 oxidation or glucose sensing.
