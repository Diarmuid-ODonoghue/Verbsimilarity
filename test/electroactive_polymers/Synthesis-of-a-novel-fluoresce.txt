The present investigation describes for the first time, the synthesis and detailed characterization of a novel fluorescent and amphiphilic chitosan polymer (3) containing fluorescent peryleneimide chromophores for biomedical applications. The polymer 3 is moderately soluble in a wide range of organic solvents and aqueous solutions, unlike chitosan (2). The Mw of 3 and 2 determined by GPC were 467 kDa and 460 kDa, respectively. The photophysical and electrochemical properties measured in solution and solid states are engrossing. is soluble in the entire pH range and exhibits excimer emission above pH 5. In solution, 3 is electroactive but 2 is not. Whereas in the solid-state, 3 shows one quasi-reversible oxidation and reversible reduction step and 2 exhibits only one quasi-reversible oxidation step. Our results point out a new class of organic biopolymers that could yield promising potentials in many biomedical applications.
