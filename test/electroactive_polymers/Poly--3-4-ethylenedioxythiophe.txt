Magnesium (Mg) is a promising biodegradable implant material because of its appropriate mechanical properties and safe degradation products. However, in vivo corrosion speed and hydrogen gas production need to be controlled for uses in biomedical applications. Here we report the development of a conducting polymer 3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene (PEDOT) and graphene oxide (GO) composite coating as a corrosion control layer. PEDOT/GO was electropolymerized on Mg samples in ethanol media. The coated Mg samples were subjected to various corrosion tests. The PEDOT/GO coating significantly reduced the rate of corrosion as evidenced by lower Mg ion concentration and pH of the corrosion media. In addition, the coating decreased the evolved hydrogen. Electrochemical analysis of the corroding samples showed more positive corrosion potential, a decreased corrosion current, and an increase in the polarization resistance. PEDOT/GO corrosion protection is attributed to three factors; an initial passive layer preventing solution ingress, buildup of negative charges in the film, and formation of corrosion protective Mg phosphate layer through redox coupling with Mg corrosion. To explore the biocompatibility of the coated implants in vitro, corrosion media from PEDOT/GO coated or uncoated Mg samples were exposed to cultured neurons where PEDOT/GO coated samples showed decreased toxicity. These results suggest that PEDOT/GO coating will be an effective treatment for controlling corrosion of Mg based medical implants.
