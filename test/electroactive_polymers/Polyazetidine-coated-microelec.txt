The present paper reports on the diffusion characteristics and electron transfer properties of a membrane obtained from polyazetidine prepolymer (PAP) consisting of repeating units of 1-(aminomethyl)-1-{2-[(6-oxyhexane)amino]ethyl}-3-hydroxyazetidinium chloride studied in the presence of seven simple redox electroactive molecules: ABTS, catechol, dopamine, ferrocenecarboxylic acid, ferricyanide, ferrocyanide, and the osmium complex bis(2,2-bipyridyl)-4-aminomethylpyridine chloride hexafluorophosphate (Os[(bpy)(2) 4-AMP Cl](+)). Using water as medium, the apparent diffusion coefficients (D(app)), the concentrations of the compounds in the membrane, and the heterogeneous rate constants (k(s)) were calculated as a function of temperature, and the influence thereof on these parameters was evaluated. Even if D(app) and k(s) values in the presence of PAP are smaller than in solution, this decrease is small enough to indicate that the PAP membrane shows excellent diffusion and electron-exchange properties with respect to other commonly used membranes reported in the literature.
