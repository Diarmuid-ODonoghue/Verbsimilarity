A series of poly(azomethine)s (PAMs) were synthesized from N1-(4-aminophenyl)-N1-(4-phenoxyphenyl)benzene-1,4-diamine (DA) and various dialdehydes to investigate the influence of structure of polymer chain and triphenylamine-based phenoxy pendant group on the optoelectronic properties. The structural characterization of the resulting poly(azomethine)s was carried out by solubility test, gel permeation chromatography, viscosity measurement, fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral and CHN elemental analysis. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of the materials were scrutinized by UV-vis, photoluminescence, time correlation photon counting spectral analysis (TCSP) and cyclic voltammetry. The thermal stability of the poly(azomethine)s was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis found to be stable upto 300 °C. These polymers exhibit moderate inherent viscosity range from 0.99 to 1.15 g dL- 1 and appreciable organosolubility. The presence of triphenylamine and azomethine (CH = N) linkage in our synthesized materials rendered them fluorescent, emitting green light upon excitation at 375 nm with quantum efficiencies of 3.9-8.5%. The pendant phenoxy group at para-position in new poly(azomethine)s has also lowered the onset oxidation potentials and elevated the HOMO levels. Additionally, the presence of conjugation increases the fluorescence time of the excited state in conjugated polymers which was found in the range 9.22-11.17 ns, sufficient to be use in future optoelectronic applications.
