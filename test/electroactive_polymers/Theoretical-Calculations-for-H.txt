Direct Heteroarylation Polymerization (DHAP) is becoming a valuable alternative to classical polymerization methods being used to synthesize π-conjugated polymers for organic electronics applications. In previous work, we showed that theoretical calculations on activation energy (Ea) of the C⁻H bonds were helpful to rationalize and predict the selectivity of the DHAP. For readers' convenience, we have gathered in this work all our previous theoretical calculations on Ea and performed new ones. Those theoretical calculations cover now most of the widely utilized electron-rich and electron-poor moieties studied in organic electronics like dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DT-DPP) derivatives. Theoretical calculations reported herein show strong modulation of the Ea of C⁻H bond on DT-DPP when a bromine atom or strong electron withdrawing groups (such as fluorine or nitrile) are added to the thienyl moiety. Based on those theoretical calculations, new cyanated dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole (CNDT-DPP) monomers and copolymers were prepared by DHAP and their electro-optical properties were compared with their non-fluorinated and fluorinated analogues.
