A procedure is described that provides for electrochemically mediated deposition of enzyme and a polymer layer permselective for endogenous electroactive species. Electrodeposition was first employed for the direct immobilization of glucose oxidase to produce a uniform, thin, and compact film on a Pt electrode. Electropolymerization of phenol was then employed to form an anti-interference and protective polyphenol film within the enzyme layer. In addition, a stability-reinforcing membrane derived from (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane was constructed by electrochemically assisted cross-linking. This hybrid film outside the enzyme layer contributed to the improved stability and permselectivity. The resulting glucose sensor was characterized by a short response time (<4 s), high sensitivity (1200 nA/mM x cm2), low interference from endogenous electroactive species, and working lifetime of more than 50 days.
