Due to its high spatiotemporal resolution, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon-fiber microelectrodes enables the localized in vivo monitoring of subsecond fluctuations in electroactive neurotransmitter concentrations. In practice, resolution of the analytical signal relies on digital background subtraction for removal of the large current due to charging of the electrical double layer as well as surface faradaic reactions. However, fluctuations in this background current often occur with changes in the electrode state or ionic environment, leading to nonspecific contributions to the FSCV data that confound data analysis. Here, we both explore the origin of such shifts seen with local changes in cations and develop a model to account for their shape. Further, we describe a convolution-based method for removal of the differential capacitive contributions to the FSCV current. The method relies on the use of a small-amplitude pulse made prior to the FSCV sweep that probes the impedance of the system. To predict the nonfaradaic current response to the voltammetric sweep, the step current response is differentiated to provide an estimate of the system's impulse response function and is used to convolute the applied waveform. The generated prediction is then subtracted from the observed current to the voltammetric sweep, removing artifacts associated with electrode impedance changes. The technique is demonstrated to remove select contributions from capacitive characteristics changes of the electrode both in vitro (i.e., in flow-injection analysis) and in vivo (i.e., during a spreading depression event in an anesthetized rat).
