This paper describes the preparation, physical properties, and electric bending actuation of a new class of active materials-ionic liquid crystal elastomers (iLCEs). It is demonstrated that iLCEs can be actuated by low-frequency AC or DC voltages of less than 1 V. The bending strains of the unoptimized first iLCEs are already comparable to the well-developed ionic electroactive polymers. Additionally, iLCEs exhibit several novel and superior features, such as the alignment that increases the performance of actuation, the possibility of preprogrammed actuation patterns at the level of the cross-linking process, and dual (thermal and electric) actuations in hybrid samples. Since liquid crystal elastomers are also sensitive to magnetic fields and can also be light sensitive, iLCEs have far-reaching potentials toward multiresponsive actuations that may have so far unmatched properties in soft robotics, sensing, and biomedical applications.
