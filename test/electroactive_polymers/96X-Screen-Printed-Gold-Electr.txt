Several alternatives are currently investigated to prevent and control the natural process of colonization of any seawater submerged surfaces by marine organisms. Since few years we develop an approach based on addressable electroactive coatings containing conducting polymers or polymers with lateral redox groups. In this article we describe the use of a screen-printed plate formed by 96 three-electrode electrochemical cells to assess the potential of these electroactive coatings to prevent the adhesion of marine bacteria. This novel platform is intended to control and record the redox properties of the electroactive coating in each well during the bioassay (15 h) and to allow screening its antiadhesion activity with enough replicates to support significant conclusions. Validation of this platform was carried out with poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as electroactive coating obtained by electropolymerization of EDOT monomer in artificial seawater electrolyte on the working electrode of each electrochemical cell of the 96-well microplate.
