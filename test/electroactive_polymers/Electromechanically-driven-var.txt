Dielectric elastomers with low elastic stiffness and high dielectric constant are smart materials that produce large strains (up to 300%) and belong to the group of electroactive polymers. Dielectric elastomer actuators are made from films of dielectric elastomers coated on both sides with compliant electrode material. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), which is known as a transparent conducting polymer, has been widely used as an interfacial layer or polymer electrode in polymer electronic devices. In this study, we propose the transparent dielectric elastomer as a material of actuator driving variable-focus lens system using PEDOT as a transparent electrode. The variable-focus lens module has light transmittance up to 70% and maximum displacement up to 450. When voltage is applied to the fabricated lens module, optical focal length is changed. We anticipate our research to be a starting point for new model of variable-focus lens system. This system could find applications in portable devices, such as digital cameras, camcorder, and cell phones.
