A closed bipolar electrode (BPE) system was developed with electrochromic poly(3-methylthiophene) (PMT) films electropolymerized on the ITO/rGO electrode as one pole of BPE in the reporting reservoir and the bare ITO electrode as another pole of BPE in the analyte reservoir, in which rGO represents reduced graphene oxide. Under a suitable driving voltage (Vtot), the electrochemical reduction/oxidation of electroactive probes, such as H2O2/glutathione (Glu), in the analyte reservoir could induce the reversible color change of PMT films in the reporting reservoir between blue and red. Based on this, a keypad lock with H2O2 , Glu, and Vtot =-3.0â€…V as the three inputs and the color change of PMT films as the visible output was established. This system was easily operated and did not need to synthesize the complex compounds or DNA molecules. The security system was easy to reset and could be used repeatedly.
