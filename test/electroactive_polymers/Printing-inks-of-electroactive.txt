Biocompatibility tests and a study of the electrical properties of thin films prepared from six electroactive polymer ink formulations based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were performed. The aim was to find a suitable formulation of PEDOT:PSS and conditions for preparing thin films in order to construct printed bioelectronic devices for biomedical applications. The stability and electrical properties of such films were tested on organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)-based sensor platforms and their biocompatibility was evaluated in assays with 3T3 fibroblasts and murine cardiomyocytes. It was found that the thin films prepared from inks without an additive or any thin film post-treatment provide limited conductivity and stability for use in biomedical applications. These properties were greatly improved by using ethylene glycol and thermal annealing. Addition or post-treatment by ethylene glycol in combination with thermal annealing provided thin films with electrical resistance and a stability sufficient to be used in sensing of animal cell physiology. These films coated with collagen IV showed good biocompatibility in the assay with 3T3 fibroblasts when compared to standard cell culture plastics. Selected films were then used in assays with murine cardiomyocytes. We observed that these cells were able to attach to the PEDOT:PSS films and form an active sensor element. Spontaneously beating clusters were formed, indicating a good physiological status for the cardiomyocyte cells. These results open the door to construction of cheap printed electronic devices for biointerfacing in biomedical applications.
