In this article interaction of transition metal complexes with DNA and its applications in electrochemical DNA biosensors as hybridization indicator or electroactive marker of DNA are reviewed. Special emphasis has been given to the efforts for the development of new transition metal complexes and their interaction to DNA. DNA and polymers covalently conjugated with transition metal complexes were also reviewed.
