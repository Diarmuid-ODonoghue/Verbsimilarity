Using the porous polypropylene (PP) films sputtered with gold and the Ni as current collectors, the electroactive materials (Ni(OH)2 and metal hydride (MH)) of positive and negative electrodes were prepared on the current collector using thick-film technology. Two types of cell configurations were prepared and the characteristics of these batteries were compared. The cycle number for the formation of batteries based on the porous PP film was found to be 2, which was significantly less than that of batteries based on the ceramic substrates. Using the porous PP film as substrate, the number of cycles for the formation of battery increased from 2 to 5 with the increase of the charge/discharge rate from 0.1C/0.025C to 2.0C/0.5C. The silver oxides dendrites formed by the oxidation of silver paste used to adhere the current collectors and the conducting wires in the charge/discharge process caused a short contact between the positive and negative electrodes, which then caused the battery failure. The cycle life of the battery based on the porous PP film was found to be greater than 400 when the charge/discharge rate was 2.0C/0.5C.
