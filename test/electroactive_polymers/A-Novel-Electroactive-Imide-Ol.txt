A novel aniline tetramer (AT) capped electroactive imide oligomer (EIO) for metal corrosion protection was successfully synthesized in this study. The chemical structure of the EIO was characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, the redox behavior of EIO was identified using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry studies. An EIO coated on a cold-rolled steel (CRS) electrode was found to possess superior corrosion resistance to polyimide (PI) on a series of electrochemical corrosion measurements in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution over an extended period (30 days). The mechanism for the advanced corrosion protection of the PI coating on the CRS electrode could be attributed to the redox catalytic capabilities of the AT units present in the EIO. These capabilities may induce the formation of passive metal oxide layers on the CRS electrode. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to analyze the surface condition of the CRS after the corrosion test. EIO- and PI-coated electrodes were identified by a series of electrochemical measurements, including corrosion potential (Ecorr), polarization resistance (Rp), and corrosion current (Icorr) measurements, along with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
