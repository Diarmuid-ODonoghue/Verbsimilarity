This research aims to improve the nerve-electrode interface of the cochlear implant using polymer technology to encourage neuron survival, elongation and adhesion to the electrodes. Polypyrrole (Ppy) doped with p-toluene sulphonate (pTS) is an electroactive polymer into which neurotrophin-3 (NT3) can be incorporated. Ppy/pTS+/-NT3 was synthesised over gold electrodes and used as a surface for auditory neuron explant culture. Neurite outgrowth from explants grown on Ppy/pTS was equivalent to tissue culture plastic but improved with the incorporation of NT3 (Ppy/pTS/NT3). Electrical stimulation of Ppy/pTS/NT3 with a biphasic current pulse, as used in cochlear implants, significantly improved neurite outgrowth from explants. Using (125)I-NT3, it was shown that low levels of NT3 passively diffused from Ppy/pTS/NT3 during normal incubation and that electrical stimulation enhanced the release of biologically active NT3 in quantities adequate for neuron survival. Furthermore, Ppy/pTS/NT3 and its constituents were not toxic to auditory neurons and the Ppy/pTS/NT3 coating on gold electrodes did not alter impedance. If applied to the cochlear implant, Ppy/pTS/NT3 will provide a biocompatible, low-impedance substrate for storage and release of NT3 to help protect auditory neurons from degradation after sensorineural hearing loss and encourage neurite outgrowth towards the electrodes.
