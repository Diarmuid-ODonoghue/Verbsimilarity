An alternative synthetic route towards the widely employed electroactive poly(TEMPO methacrylate) (PTMA) via a thermally robust methoxyamine-protecting group is demonstrated herein. Protection of the radical moiety of hydroxy-TEMPO with a methyl functionality and subsequent esterification with methacrylic anhydride allows the high-yielding formation of the novel monomer methyl-TEMPO methacrylate (MTMA). The polymerization of MTMA to poly(MTMA) (PMTMA) is investigated via free radical polymerization and reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT), a reversible-deactivation radical polymerization technique. Cleavage of the temperature-stable methoxyamine functionality by oxidative treatment of PMTMA with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) releases the electroactive PTMA. The redox activity of PTMA was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry in lithium-ion coin cells.
