A procedure is described that provides co-immobilization of enzyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA) within an alumina sol-gel matrix and a polyphenol layer permselective for endogenous electroactive species. BSA has first been employed for the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) on a Pt electrode in a sol-gel to produce a uniform, thin and compact film with enhanced enzyme activity. Electropolymerization of phenol was then employed to form an anti-interference and protective polyphenol film within the enzyme layer. In addition, a stability-reinforcing membrane derived from (3-aminopropyl)-trimethoxysilane was constructed by electrochemically-assisted crosslinking. This hybrid film outside the enzyme layer contributed both to the improved stability and to permselectivity. The resulting glucose sensor was characterized by a short response time (<10 s), high sensitivity (10.4 nA/mM mm(2)), low interference from endogenous electroactive species, and a working lifetime of at least 60 days.
