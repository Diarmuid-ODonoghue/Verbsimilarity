To obtain one biodegradable and electroactive polymer as the scaffold for tissue engineering, the multiblock copolymer PLAAP was designed and synthesized with the condensation polymerization of hydroxyl-capped poly( l-lactide) (PLA) and carboxyl-capped aniline pentamer (AP). The PLAAP copolymer exhibited excellent electroactivity, solubility, and biodegradability. At the same time, as one scaffold material, PLAAP copolymer possesses certain mechanical properties with the tensile strength of 3 MPa, tensile Young 's modulus of 32 MPa, and breaking elongation rate of 95%. We systematically studied the compatibility of PLAAP copolymer in vitro and proved that the electroactive PLAAP copolymer was innocuous, biocompatible, and helpful for the adhesion and proliferation of rat C6 cells. Moreover, the PLAAP copolymer stimulated by electrical signals was demonstrated as accelerating the differentiation of rat neuronal pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells. This biodegradable and electroactive PLAAP copolymer thus possessed the properties in favor of the long-time application in vivo as nerve repair scaffold materials in tissue engineering.
