Organic electrode materials are a highly promising and environmentally benign class of battery materials with radical polymers being at the forefront of this research. Herein, we report the first example of the 1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl class of nitroxides as an organic electrode material and the synthesis and application of a novel styrenic nitroxide polymer, poly(5-vinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl) (PVTMIO). The polymer was synthesized from the precursor monomer, 2-methoxy-5-vinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindoline, and subsequent oxidative deprotection yielded the electroactive radical species. Cyclic voltammetry revealed a high oxidation potential of 3.7 V versus Li, placing it among the top of the nitroxide class of electrode materials. The suitability of PVTMIO for utilization in a high-voltage organic radical battery was confirmed with a discharge capacity of 104.7 mAh g-1, high rate performance, and stability under cycling conditions (90% capacity retention after 100 cycles), making it one of the highest reported organic p-dopable cathode materials.
