In this paper the voltammetric behaviors of imipramine.HCl and amitriptyline. HCl, which are both tricyclic antidepressants, were investigated using a carbon paste electrode, modified by the addition of poly(N-vinylimidazole), in various solutions of different pHs. It was shown that the current density for imipramine increased with modification of the carbon paste electrode and amitriptyline, which was electroinactive with the normal carbon paste electrode, became electroactive on the modified electrode. The optimum conditions for the quantitive determination of imipramine.HCl and amitriptyline.HCl were determined and statistical analysis of the linear relationship between current and concentration is given. The method was applied for the determination of these substances in the pharmaceutical dosage forms.
