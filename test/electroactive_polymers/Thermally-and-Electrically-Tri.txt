This work aimed to develop a facile and broadly applicable method for fabricating multistimuli responsive triple-shape memory polymers (SMPs). Hence, herein the SMPs were prepared through the simple physical blending of two commercially available biopolymers, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc), in the presence of robust and conductive graphene nanoplatelets. Interestingly, atomic force microscopy observations and thermal analyses revealed that the presence of nanofillers led to phase separation and appearance of two well-separated transition temperatures in the blend of these two miscible polymers. Consequently, shape memory results showed that the unfilled blend of PLA/PVAc with a single thermal transition can only show moderate heat triggered dual-shape memory behavior. While, PLA/PVAc/graphene nanocomposite blends demonstrated excellent thermally and electrically actuated triple-shape memory effects besides their remarkable dual-shape memory behavior. In addition, electrical conductivity of the blend was enhanced by âˆ¼14 orders of magnitude in the presence of graphene. More interestingly, electroactive shape recovery experiments exhibited that depending on the applied voltage, temporary shapes in each region of sample can be either individually or simultaneously recovered.
