Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is a critically important signaling molecule. Endogenous H(2)O(2) mediates diverse physiological processes both intra- and intercellularly; and enzymatically generated H(2)O(2) is a widely used reporter molecule at biosensors that rely on enzymes to detect non-electroactive species. However, the development and application of electroanalytical methods for the direct detection of this molecule has been challenging because the electron transfer kinetics for the irreversible oxidation of H(2)O(2) are slow. We comparatively characterize the electrochemical oxidation of H(2)O(2) on bare and Nafion(®)-coated platinum and carbon-fiber microdisc electrodes using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). Using a waveform ranging from +0.2 to +1.3 V at 400 V s(-1), the electrocatalytic properties of the platinum surface were not readily apparent, and the carbon-fiber microelectrode demonstrated greater sensitivity and selectivity toward H(2)O(2). Nafion(®)-coating further enhanced detection on carbon electrodes. These results confirm that platinum electrodes, with or without Nafion(®), will not work acceptably with this approach, and confirm the value of carbon-fiber microelectrodes relative to more traditionally used platinum electrodes in the direct detection of rapid H(2)O(2) fluctuations using FSCV.
