This paper discusses basic electrochemical immunoassay technology. Factors limiting the practical application of antibodies to analytical problems are also presented. It addresses the potential use of immunoassay methods based on electrochemical detection for the analysis of environmental samples. It provides examples for the detection and quantitation of environmental samples using conducting electroactive polymers (CEPs). CEP-based immunosensing systems are compared with conventional environmental immunoassay procedures. The advantages of using these types of sensors for rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective analysis of pesticides and toxic chemicals are analysed and discussed. CEP-based immunosensing technology might eventually be used for continuous monitoring of effluents such as waste streams to determine compliance with regulations. CEP-based sensors are suitable for monitoring ground-water, waste stream effluents, agricultural run-offs and for monitoring the effectiveness of remediation, or for other situations where a real-time monitoring capability is desired.
