An ultrasensitive electrochemical aptasensor for multiplex antibiotics detection based on endonuclease and exonuclease assisted dual recycling amplification strategy was proposed. Kanamycin and chloramphenicol were selected as candidates. Firstly, aptamers of the antibiotics were immobilized on bar A and then binding with their endonuclease labeled complementary DNA strands to construct enzyme-cleavage probes. Secondly, The nano zirconium-metal organic framework (NMOF) particles with 1,4-benzene-dicarboxylate (BDC) as linker was defined as UiO-66. And its updated version, hierarchically porous UiO-66 (HP-UIO-66) decorated with different electroactive materials as signal tags were synthesized. Then they were immobilized on bar B linked by two duplex DNA strands which can be specifically cleaved by corresponding enzyme-cleavage probes in bar A. Once targets were introduced into system, aptamers can capture them and then release enzyme-cleavage probes. In the presence of exonuclease-I, exonuclease assisted target recycling amplification was triggered and more enzyme-cleavage probes were released into solution. The probes can trigger endonuclease assisted recycles and repeatedly cleave their corresponding duplex DNA strands on bar B then released numerous signal tags into supernatant. Thus two recycling amplification was performed in the system. Finally, MB and Fc in the signal tags were detected by square wave voltammetry after removing bar A/B and the current intensities were correspondent with the concentration of KANA and CAP respectively. Under the optimum condition, the limits of detection for the KANA and CAP were 35fM and 21fM respectively with a wide linear range from 1 Ã— 10-4 to 50nM. This dual recycling amplification detection system exhibited high sensitivities and specificity. It can be easily extended to detect other targets if changing the corresponding aptamers and has potential application values for screening of multiplex antibiotics residues in food safety.
