In this work, a novel two-step construction strategy for protein layer-by-layer assembly films was proposed. In the first step, positively charged hemoglobin (Hb) or myoglobin (Mb) at pH 5.0 was adsorbed on the negatively charged surface of 500 nm diameter-sized polystyrene (PS) latex beads, forming core-shell structured PS-protein particles. In the next step, the PS-protein particles were further assembled layer by layer with oppositely charged poly(styrene sulfonate)(PSS) on various solid surfaces under suitable conditions. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and UV-vis spectroscopy were used to monitor the growth of {(PS-protein)/PSS}(n) films. The stable {(PS-protein)/PSS}(n) films modified on pyrolytic graphite (PG) electrodes demonstrated good electroactivity in protein-free buffer, which was originated from protein heme Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couples, and the electroactivity extended to six (PS-protein)/PSS bilayers. UV-vis spectroscopy showed that Hb and Mb in the films retained their near-native structure in the medium pH range. {(PS-protein)/PSS}(n) films catalyzed electrochemical reduction of oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and nitrite with a significant lowering of overpotential, and displayed better catalytic activity than corresponding cast PS-protein films.
