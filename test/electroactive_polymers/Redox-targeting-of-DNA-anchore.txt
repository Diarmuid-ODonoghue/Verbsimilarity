A key issue associated with electrochemical DNA-based biosensors is how to enhance DNA immobilization on the substrates. In order to improve the immobilization of DNA and to optimize DNA interaction efficiency, different kinds of strategies have been developed. In this regard, nanomaterials have attracted a great deal of attention in electrode surface modification for DNA biosensor fabrication. In this study, nanostructured films were deposited at the surface of a pencil graphite electrode (PGE) as a working electrode. For the present purpose, common polyelectrolytes are used for surface modification with double-stranded DNA. Two positively charged polyelectrolyte, namely poly dialyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and chitosan, are initially compared for DNA immobilization at the surface of MWCNTs and TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2NPs). In a second step, the basic electrochemical properties of the sensors are investigated using voltammetric methods. The modified electrodes are also characterized by scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance measurements. It will be shown that electrode modification with DNA and the nanostructure that disperses in PDDA leads to an enhanced sensitivity of the DNA voltammetric detection mechanism. In a previous study, a comparison was done between MWCNTs and TiO2NPs for determining the effect of nanoparticle effect on DNA immobilization on the electrode surface. In order to compare the efficiency of the prepared DNA-based biosensors, methylene blue is chosen as an electroactive probe. It will be shown that the stability of the immobilized DNA within several days will be much higher when MWCNTs rather than TiO2NPs are used.
