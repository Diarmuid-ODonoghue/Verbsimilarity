Stereo-electroencephalography depth electrodes, regularly implanted into drug-resistant patients with focal epilepsy to localize the epileptic focus, have a low channel count (6-12 macro- or microelectrodes), limited spatial resolution (0.5-1 cm) and large contact area of the recording sites (~mm2). Thus, they are not suited for high-density local field potential and multiunit recordings. In this paper, we evaluated the long-term electrophysiological recording performance and histocompatibility of a neural interface consisting of 32 microelectrodes providing a physical shape similar to clinical devices. The cylindrically-shaped depth probes made of polyimide (PI) were chronically implanted for 13 weeks into the brain of rats, while cortical or thalamic activity (local field potentials, single-unit and multi-unit activity) was recorded regularly to monitor the temporal change of several features of the electrophysiological performance. To examine the tissue reaction around the probe, neuron-selective and astroglia-selective immunostaining methods were applied. Stable single-unit and multi-unit activity were recorded for several weeks with the implanted depth probes and a weak or moderate tissue reaction was found around the probe track. Our data on biocompatibility presented here and in vivo experiments in non-human primates provide a strong indication that this type of neural probe can be applied in stereo-electroencephalography recordings of up to 2 weeks in humans targeting the localization of epileptic foci providing an increased spatial resolution and the ability to monitor local field potentials and neuronal spiking activity.
