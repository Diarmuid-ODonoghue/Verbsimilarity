Polyaniline nanotubes were successfully synthesized by a facile in situ chemical oxidative polymerization method using urea as soft template. When the urea/aniline molar ratio is 3:1, the as-prepared nanotubular polyaniline (PANI-3) shows regular and uniform square capillaries, which provides a high electrode/electrolyte contact, easy ion diffusion and enhanced electroactive regions during the electrochemical process, leading to weak internal resistance and improved electrochemical performance. The PANI-3 sample exhibits a high specific capacitance of 405 F/g at current density of 0.2 A/g, and PANI only has a specific capacitance of 263 F/g. At current density of 1 A/g, the capacitance of PANI-3 is still 263 F/g (64.9% of the capacitance at 0.2 A/g). Such a PANI-3 nanotube, with regular and uniform capillary, is a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
