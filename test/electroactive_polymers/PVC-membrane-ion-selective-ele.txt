New PVC membrane electrodes selective for the determination of hyoscyamine ion (Hy(+)) based on hyoscyamine tetraphenylborate (Hy-TPB) or hyoscyamine phosphotungstate (Hy-PT) ion-exchangers as electroactive materials are described. The electrodes show a linear response for Hy(+) over the concentration range of 1.00 x 10(-5) to 1.26 x 10(-2) mol L(-1) and 1.00 x 10(-4) to 1.00 x 10(-2) mol L(-1) in case of Hy-TPB electrode applying batch and flow injection analysis (FIA), respectively, and 1.00 x 10(-5) to 4.52 x 10(-3) mol L(-1) and 6.31 x 10(-5) to 1.00 x 10(-2) mol L(-1) in case of Hy-PT electrode for batch and FIA, respectively. The lower detection limits are 3.90 x 10(-6) and 4.51 x 10(-6) at 25 degrees C for Hy-TPB and Hy-PT electrodes, respectively. The electrodes posses near Nernstian slopes of 56.5 and 57.8 mV/decade for Hy-TPB and Hy-PT electrodes, respectively, and a fast potential response of < or =20 s which is almost constant over a pH range of 3-10. Selectivity coefficient data for some common inorganic cations, sugars, amino acids and the components, other than hyoscyamine, of the mixed drugs investigated show negligible interference. The electrodes have been applied to the potentiometric determination of hyoscyamine in pure solution and in pharmaceutical preparations under batch and FIA conditions and as end point indicator electrode for the determination of hyoscyanine using potentiometric titration. For the concentrations (1.08 x 10(-5) mol L(-1) to 3.16 x 10(-3) mol L(-1)) an average recovery of 99.95% with relative standard deviation of 0.63% has been achieved. The effect of temperature on the electrodes was also studied.
