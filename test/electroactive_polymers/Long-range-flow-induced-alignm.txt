Helical rosette nanotubes are obtained through the self-assembly of low molecular weight synthetic modules in water. Here we demonstrate that despite their dynamic nature, these materials respond very well to directional fluid flow and assume long-range order on flat substrates. Persistence length, order, and packing of the rosette nanotubes were found to depend dramatically on the surface properties of both the substrate and the nanotubes and vary from well-ordered long-range 2D films to bundled nanotubes or amorphous conglomerates. While flow-induced long-range alignment of dynamic nanostructures is unprecedented, the chemical tunability of the rosette nanotubes is anticipated to offer a versatile means for investigating the basis of interfacial forces in self-assembled organo-silicon devices and their effect on the stability and physical properties of organic nanostructures on electroactive surfaces.
