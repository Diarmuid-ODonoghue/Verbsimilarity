Blends of PAni and PLCL are electrospun to prepare uniform fibers for the development of electrically conductive, engineered nerve grafts. PC12 cell viability is significantly higher on RPACL fibers than on PLCL-only fibers, and the electrical conductivity of the fibers affects the differentiation of PC12 cells; the number of cells positively-stained and their expression level are significantly higher on RPACL fibers. PC12 cell bodies display an oriented morphology with outgrowing neurites. On RPACL fibers, the expression level of paxillin, cdc-42, and rac is positively affected and proteins including RhoA and ERK exist as more activated state. These results suggest that electroactive fibers may hold promise as a guidance scaffold for neuronal tissue engineering.
