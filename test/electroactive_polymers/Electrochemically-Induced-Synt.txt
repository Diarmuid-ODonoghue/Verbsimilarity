The formation of a poly(2,6-carbazole) derivative during an electrochemical polymerization process is shown. Comparison of 3,5-bis(9-octyl-9H-carbazol-2-yl)pyridine and 3,5-bis(9-octyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)pyridine by electrochemical and UV-Vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical measurements and DFT (density functional theory) calculation prove the formation of a poly(2,6-carbazole) derivative. Both of the compounds form stable and electroactive conjugated polymers.
