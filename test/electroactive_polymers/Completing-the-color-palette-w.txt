The field of electrochromic polymers has now reached an important milestone with the availability of a yellow to fully transmissive, cathodically coloring, solution-processable electroactive polymer. This is in addition to previously published electrochromic polymers that have neutral state colors that span from orange, red, magenta, blue, cyan, green, and black, that also attain highly transmissive states upon switching. With this, the full color palette is now complete allowing the largest variety of colors for transmissive and reflective electrochromic display applications. Here, we report on how we have been able to obtain this full color palette through synthetic modifications and color tuning utilizing electron rich and donor-acceptor repeat units, electron-donating substituents, and steric interactions with our 3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene family of polymers. Additionally, using solubilizing pendant groups for both organic and aqueous compatibility, we have been able to create this color palette with fully solution processable materials, paving the way for materials patterning, printing, and incorporation into devices for display and window applications.
