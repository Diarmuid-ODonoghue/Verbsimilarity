Greatly enhanced energy density in poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-CTFE)] is realized through interface effects induced by a photo cross-linking method. Being different from nanocomposites with lowered dielectric strength, the cross-linked P(VDF-CTFE)s possess a high breakdown field as well as remarkably elevated polarization, both of which contribute to the enhanced energy density as high as 22.5 J · cm(-3). Moreover, patterned thin films with various shapes and sizes are fabricated by photolithography, which sheds new light on the integration of PVDF-based electroactive polymers into organic microelectronic devices such as flexible pyroelectric/piezoelectric sensor arrays or non-volatile ferroelectric memory devices.
