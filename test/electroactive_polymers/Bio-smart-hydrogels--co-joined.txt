Two classes of polymers that are currently receiving widespread attention in biosensor development are hydrogels and conducting electroactive polymers. The present study reports on the integration of these two materials to produce electroactive hydrogel composites that physically entrap enzymes within their matrices for biosensor construction and chemically stimulated controlled release. Enhanced biosensing capabilities of these membranes have been demonstrated in the fabrication of glucose, cholesterol and galactose amperometric biosensors. All biosensors displayed extended linear response ranges (10(-5)-10(-2) M), rapid response times (<60 s), retained storage stabilities of up to 1 year, and excellent screening of the physiological interferents ascorbic acid, uric acid, and acetaminophen. When the cross-linked hydrogel components of these composite membranes were prepared with the amine containing dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate monomer the result was polymeric devices that swelled in response to pH changes (neutral to acidic). Entrapment of glucose oxidase within these materials made them glucose-responsive through the formation of gluconic acid. When insulin was co-loaded with glucose oxidase into these "bio-smart" devices, there was a twofold increase in insulin release rate when the devices were immersed in glucose solutions. This demonstrates the potential of such systems to function as a chemically-synthesized artificial pancreas.
