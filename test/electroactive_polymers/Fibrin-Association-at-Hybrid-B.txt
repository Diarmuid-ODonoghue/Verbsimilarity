The properties as biointerfaces of electroactive conducting polymer-peptide biocomposites formed by poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and CREKA or CR(NMe)EKA peptide sequences (where Glu has been replaced by N-methyl-Glu in the latter) have been compared. CREKA is a linear pentapeptide that recognizes clotted plasma proteins and selectively homes to tumors, while CR(NMe)EKA is an engineer to improve such properties by altering peptide-fibrin interactions. Differences between PEDOT-CREKA and PEDOT-CR(NMe)EKA reflect dissemblance in the organization of the peptides into the polymeric matrix. Both peptides affect fibrinogen thrombin-catalyzed polymerization causing the immediate formation of fibrin, whereas in the absence of thrombin this phenomenon is only observed for CR(NMe)EKA. Consistently, the fibrin-adsorption capacity is higher for PEDOT-CR(NMe)EKA than for PEDOT-CREKA, even though in both cases adsorbed fibrin exhibits round-like morphologies rather than the characteristic fibrous structure. PEDOT-peptide films coated with fibrin are selective in terms of cell adhesion, promoting the attachment of metastatic cells with respect to normal cells.
