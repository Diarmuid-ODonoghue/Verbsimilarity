Conductive polymers are potential selective ion-exchange membrane materials. In this study, a novel redox transistor electrodialyzer consisting of two chambers separated by a polypyrrole (PPy) membrane electrode was designed for potassium ion (K+) recovery from water. The PPy membrane electrode was fabricated by depositing PPy on a stainless-steel wire mesh through the electrochemical method. Based on ion-exchange results, the PPy membrane exhibited electrodialysis selectivity for K+ in the presence of Na+, with a K+/Na+ separation factor of 2.10. Adding modified active carbon to PPy provided a larger electroactive area and better conductivity, resulting in higher ion-exchange capacity (1.04 mmol/L) compared with the original PPy membrane. Even for seawater containing a very low concentration of K+ (16.18 mmol/L), the PPy membrane still demonstrated K+ selectivity (separation factor of 2.18). Energy consumption in the electrodialyzer was 3.80 kW h/kg K, which was 37% lower than that in traditional electrodialysis. Furthermore, the PPy membrane exhibited antiscaling/fouling ability with the help of a pulse voltage. These findings highlight a novel redox transistor electrodialysis process with great potential application in K+ recovery from wastewater with relatively low energy consumption.
