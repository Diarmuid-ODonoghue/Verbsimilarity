This paper reports the construction of the gold/mercaptobenzothiazole/polyaniline/acetylcholinesterase/polyvinylacetate (Au/ MBT/PANI/AChE/PVAc) thick-film biosensor for the determination of certain organophosphate pesticide solutions in selected aqueous organic solvent solutions. The Au/MBT/PANI/AChE/PVAc electrocatalytic biosensor device was constructed by encapsulating acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme in the PANI polymer composite, followed by the coating of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) on top to secure the biosensor film from disintegration in the organic solvents evaluated. The electroactive substrate called acetylthiocholine (ATCh) was employed to provide the movement of electrons in the amperometric biosensor. The voltammetric results have shown that the current shifts more anodically as the Au/MBT/PANI/AChE/PVAc biosensor responded to successive acetylthiocholine (ATCh) substrate addition under anaerobic conditions in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, KCl (pH 7.2) solution and aqueous organic solvent solutions. For the Au/MBT/PANI/AChE/PVAc biosensor, various performance and stability parameters were evaluated. These factors include the optimal enzyme loading, effect of pH, long-term stability of the biosensor, temperature stability of the biosensor, the effect of polar organic solvents, and the effect of non-polar organic solvents on the amperometric behavior of the biosensor. The biosensor was then applied to detect a series of 5 organophosphorous pesticides in aqueous organic solvents and the pesticides studied were parathion-methyl, malathion and chlorpyrifos. The results obtained have shown that the detection limit values for the individual pesticides were 1.332 nM (parathion-methyl), 0.189 nM (malathion), 0.018 nM (chlorpyrifos).
