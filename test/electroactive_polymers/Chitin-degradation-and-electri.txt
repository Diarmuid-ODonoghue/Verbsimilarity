Chitin is one of the most abundant biopolymers in nature and the main composition of shrimp and crab shells (usually as food wastes). Thus it is essential to investigate the potential of degrading chitin for energy recovery. This study investigated the anaerobic degradation of chitin by Aeromonas hydrophila, a chitinolytic and popular electroactive bacterium, in both fermentation and microbial fuel cell (MFC) systems. The primary chitin metabolites produced in MFC were succinate, lactate, acetate, formate, and ethanol. The total metabolite concentration from chitin degradation increased seven-fold in MFC compared to the fermentation system, as well as additional electricity generation. Moreover, A. hydrophila degraded GlcNAc (the intermediate of chitin hydrolysis) significantly faster (0.97 and 0.94 mM C/d/mM-GlcNAc) than chitin (0.13 and 0.03 mM C/d/mM-GlcNAc) in MFC and fermentation systems, indicating that extracellular hydrolysis of chitin was the rate-limiting step and this step could be accelerated in MFC. Furthermore, more chemicals produced by the addition of exogenous mediators in MFC. This study proves that the chitin could be degraded effectively by an electroactive bacterium in MFC, and our results suggest that this bioelectrochemical system might be useful for the degradation of recalcitrant biomass to recover energy.
