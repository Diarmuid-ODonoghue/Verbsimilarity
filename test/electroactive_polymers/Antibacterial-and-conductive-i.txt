Biomaterials with injectability, conductivity and antibacterial effect simultaneously have been rarely reported. Herein, we developed a new series of in situ forming antibacterial conductive degradable hydrogels using quaternized chitosan (QCS) grafted polyaniline with oxidized dextran as crosslinker. The chemical structures, morphologies, electrochemical property, conductivity, swelling ratio, rheological property, in vitro biodegradation and gelation time of hydrogels were characterized. Injectability was verified by in vivo subcutaneous injection on a Sprague Dawley rat. The antibacterial activity of the hydrogels was firstly evaluated employing antibacterial assay using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. The hydrogels containing polyaniline showed enhanced antibacterial activity compared to QCS hydrogel, especially for hydrogels with 3 wt% polyaniline showing 95 kill% and 90kill% for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Compared with QCS hydrogel, the hydrogels with 3 wt% polyaniline still showed enhanced antibacterial activity for E. coli in vivo. The adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the hydrogels and hydrogels with polyaniline showed better cytocompatibility than QCS hydrogel. The electroactive hydrogels could significantly enhance the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts compared to QCS hydrogel. This work opens the way to fabricate in situ forming antibacterial and electroactive degradable hydrogels as a new class of bioactive scaffolds for tissue regeneration applications.
