Conducting polymers are promising materials for advanced neuroprostheses and neural repair devices. However, these challenging technologies demand stable presentation of multiple biomolecules on the polymer surface and fabrication of scaffolds suitable for implantation. We electrosynthesised poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly[(4-styrenesulfonic acid)-co-(maleic acid)] (PEDOT:PSS-co-MA) on gold-coated surfaces or carbon microfibres, functionalised the polymer by covalent immobilisation of anti-IgG antibodies and subsequent binding of N-Cadherin and L1 recombinant proteins, and used these materials as substrates for culturing cerebral cortex neurons. N-Cadherin and L1 were much more effective than polylysine in promoting axonal elongation and collateralisation on the polymer. However, N-Cadherin also induced cell migration and dendritic extension and branching, whereas L1 inhibited dendrites. Dual functionalisation with N-Cadherin and L1 produced synergistic effects on neuronal growth that could not be achieved with either of the proteins when used alone. PEDOT:PSS-co-MA electrosynthesised on carbon microfibres showed good electrochemical properties and, when biofunctionalised with N-Cadherin or L1, stimulated very long and guided axonal elongation. Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry showed that the good electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS-co-MA were not degraded by covalent peptide attachment, indicating that this polymer is suitable for multiple biofunctionalisation of electroactive surfaces in neuroprosthetic and lesion-bridging applications.
