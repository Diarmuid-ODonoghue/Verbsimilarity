This chapter aims to present recent examples of supramolecular functionalization of carbon nanotubes. The non-covalent functionalization appears as a solution for the future applications in nanotechnologies since it allows the functionalization and manipulation of nanotubes without the introduction of sp (3) defects in the π-conjugated system. Thus, the optical and electronic properties of the nanotubes remain preserved. In the first part of this chapter, we present the use of surfactant for the dispersion of nanotubes and its application for sorting. Then we report several examples of functionalization of nanotubes based on π-stacking interactions with pyrene derivatives. Finally, in the last part we review the wrapping of photo/electroactive polymers around the nanotube sidewalls. We put a particular focus on polyflurorene-based polymers and we show their utilization for the separation of nanotubes in diameter and chirality.
