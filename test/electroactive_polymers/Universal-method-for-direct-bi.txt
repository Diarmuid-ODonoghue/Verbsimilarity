We report HRP-catalyzed polymerization of Tannic acid (TA) and application of the poly (Tannic acid) (p(TA)) as a versatile platform for covalent immobilization of biomolecules on various electrode surfaces based on electrochemical oxidation of the p(TA) and subsequent oxidative coupling reactions with the biomolecules. We also used this method for capturing cancer cells through a linker molecule, folic acid (FA). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the p(TA)-modified surface could be used for simultaneous electrochemical determination of biologically important electroactive molecules such as ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA). This HRP-catalyzed polymerization of TA and p(TA)-mediated surface modification method can provide a simple and new framework to construct multifunctional platforms for covalent attachment of biomolecules and development of sensitive electrochemical sensing devices.
