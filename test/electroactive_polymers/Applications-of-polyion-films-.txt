This paper describes several applications of polyion-biomolecule films on electrodes related to future development of in vitro chemical toxicity sensors. In the first example, composite films of DNA and ionomers cast onto pyrolytic graphite (PG) electrodes are shown to be useful for detecting DNA damage during incubation with the carcinogen styrene oxide at pH 5.5. Single electrodes can be used to estimate relative damage rates by derivative square wave voltammetry. Films containing the ionomer Nafion gave better reproducibility than another ionomer, Eastman AQ38. In the second example, films containing redox proteins myoglobin (Mb) and cytochrome (cyt) P450cam were constructed in alternate layers with polyions including DNA on rough PG electrodes. Films with reversible protein FeIII/FeII electrochemistry with up to 7 electroactive layers were made. Amounts of electroactive protein on rough PG that were 7 to 17-fold larger than in similar films on smooth gold were achieved because many more layers were electroactive. Films of Mb/DNA also showed oxidation peaks after short incubations with styrene oxide that may be attributable to DNA damage. Results are relevant to the future design of enzyme-DNA films which convert pollutants and drugs to reactive metabolites, followed by electrochemical detection of the resulting DNA damage.
