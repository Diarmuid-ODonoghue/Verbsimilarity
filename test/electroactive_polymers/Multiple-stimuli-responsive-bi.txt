In the present work, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAA) composite films were electrodeposited onto the surface of Au electrodes in a fast and one-step manner from an aqueous mixture of a graphene oxide (GO) dispersion and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAA) monomer solutions. Reflection-absorption infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopies were employed to characterize the successful construction of the rGO/PNIPAA composite films. The rGO/PNIPAA composite films exhibited reversible potential-, pH-, temperature-, and sulfate-sensitive cyclic voltammetric (CV) on-off behavior to the electroactive probe ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (Fc(COOH)2). For instance, after the composite films were treated at -0.7 V for 7 min, the CV responses of Fc(COOH)2 at the rGO/PNIPAA electrodes were quite large at pH 8.0, exhibiting the on state. However, after the films were treated at 0 V for 30 min, the CV peak currents became much smaller, demonstrating the off state. The mechanism of the multiple-stimuli switchable behaviors for the system was investigated not only by electrochemical methods but also by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The potential-responsive behavior for this system was mainly attributed to the transformation between rGO and GO in the films at different potentials. The film system was further used to realize multiple-stimuli responsive bioelectrocatalysis of glucose catalyzed by the enzyme of glucose oxidase and mediated by the electroactive probe of Fc(COOH)2 in solution. On the basis of this, a four-input enabled OR (EnOR) logic gate network was established.
