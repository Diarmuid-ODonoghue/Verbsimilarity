Electrical stimulation for delivery of biochemical agents such as genes, proteins and RNA molecules amongst others, holds great potential for controlled therapeutic delivery and in promoting tissue regeneration. Electroactive biomaterials have the capability of delivering these agents in a localized, controlled, responsive and efficient manner. These systems have also been combined for the delivery of both physical and biochemical cues and can be programmed to achieve enhanced effects on healing by establishing control over the microenvironment. This review focuses on current state-of-the-art research in electroactive-based materials towards the delivery of drugs and other therapeutic signalling agents for wound care treatment. Future directions and current challenges for developing effective electroactive approach based therapies for wound care are discussed.
