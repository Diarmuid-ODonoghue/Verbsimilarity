An electrochemical strategy on the basis of rationally designed molecularly imprinted sol-gel polymer embedded with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is developed for the specific and sensitive determination of Sudan I. The rationally designed sensing Sudan I imprinted sol-gel was prepared by mixing Sudan I with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, chitosan, and AuNPs, followed by copolymerization and extraction of the template molecules. The hybrid forming membrane was characterized by SEM and FTIR-ATR, and used for the linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) determination of Sudan I in water/ethanol solutions. The LSV responses exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, as discriminated from Sudan I analogues. Under optimal experimental conditions, LSV peak currents were linearly proportional to the concentrations of Sudan I in the range from 0.1 × 10(-7) to 1.0 × 10(-5)M, with a detection limit of 2.0 × 10(-9)M. The strategy is generally applicable in developing sensitive, selective, and moreover, reusable electrochemical sensors for quantitative determination of electroactive species.
