Six star-shaped oligomers containing triphenylamine (D1-D3) and benzene unit (D4-D6) as cores have been synthesized by Wittig condensation or Heck coupling reaction using aromatic aldehydes and triphenylphosphonium salts or aromatic halogenated compounds with vinyl triphenylamine. All oligomers have well-defined molecular structure and high purity. Characterization of the oligomers was made by FT-IR, (1)H-NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The electrochemical behavior was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cyclic voltammograms have revealed that oligomers undergo quasireversible or irreversible redox processes. The irreversible process is associated with electrochemical polymerization of oligomers by dimerization of unsubstituted triphenylamine groups. Thermal characterization was accomplished by TGA and DSC methods and evidenced that all oligomers were stable materials until 250Â°C and have formed stable molecular glasses after first heating scan.
