For the first time a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) with direct electron transfer (DET) and bioelectrocatalytic activity of the target protein is presented. Thin films of MIPs for the recognition of a hexameric tyrosine-coordinated heme protein (HTHP) have been prepared by electropolymerization of scopoletin after oriented assembly of HTHP on a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) on gold electrodes. Cavities which should resemble the shape and size of HTHP were formed by template removal. Rebinding of the target protein sums up the recognition by non-covalent interactions between the protein and the MIP with the electrostatic attraction of the protein by the SAM. HTHP bound to the MIP exhibits quasi-reversible DET which is reflected by a pair of well pronounced redox peaks in the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) with a formal potential of -184.4 Â± 13.7 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) at pH 8.0 and it was able to catalyze the cathodic reduction of peroxide. At saturation the MIP films show a 12-fold higher electroactive surface concentration of HTHP than the non-imprinted polymer (NIP).
