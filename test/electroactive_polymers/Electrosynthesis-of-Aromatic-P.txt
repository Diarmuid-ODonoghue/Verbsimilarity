Two electropolymerizable monomers with a methoxytriphenylamine core linked via amide groups to two triphenylamine (TPA) or N-phenylcarbazole (NPC) terminal groups, namely 4,4'-bis(4-diphenylaminobenzamido)-4''-methoxytriphenylamine (MeOTPA-(TPA)₂) and 4,4'-bis(4-(carbazol-9-yl)benzamido)-4''-methoxytriphenylamine (MeOTPA-(NPC)₂), were synthesized and characterized by FTIR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical polymerization reactions of these MeOTPA-cored monomers over indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode allow the generation of electroactive poly(amide-amine) films. The electro-generated polymer films exhibited reversible redox processes and multi-colored electrochromic behaviors upon electro-oxidation, together with moderate coloration efficiency and cycling stability. The optical density changes (ΔOD) were observed in the range of 0.18⁻0.68 at specific absorption maxima, with the calculated coloration efficiencies of 42⁻123 cm²/C. Single-layer electrochromic devices using the electrodeposited polymer films as active layers were fabricated for the preliminary investigation of their electrochromic applications.
