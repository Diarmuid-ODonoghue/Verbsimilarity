Present paper describes the results of a novel method which combines the Head space (HS) preconcentration of the analyte on the electrode prior to the voltammetric analysis. Thereafter, the method was called HS-Voltammetry. The performance of the method was tested upon using an electroactive and volatile molecule, phenol molecule, which gives an oxidation peak at conventional electrodes. In this study, a glassy carbon electrode was modified with polypyrrole by electropolymerization and then, the electrode was placed over the solution in a sealed vial heated gently on a hotplate with a stirrer for phenol determination. By controlling the thickness of the polymeric coating and optimizing preconcentration parameters such as vial pH and temperature, stirring rate and exposure time, a very consistent (5.2% at 5.0×10(-7) M) fraction of the analyte can be extracted during a predetermined time. The oxidation peak current at 0.8 V depended linearly on the phenol concentration over a wide range (3 orders of magnitude). The detection limit was estimated as 7.0×10(-8) M at 60 °C (S/N=3) which is well below the limit set by the European Community for phenols in wastewaters (ca. 5×10(-6) M). The effect of other phenolic compounds was also examined and it was shown that head space preconcentration eliminated the interference of non-volatile phenolic acids studied. For volatile phenolic compounds, the selectivity can be maintained in cases when isolated peaks are obtained for each component. The proposed method has been applied successfully for the determination of phenol in artificial wastewater and recovery percentage was calculated as 93%.
