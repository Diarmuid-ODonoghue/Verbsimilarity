Herein, a special microheterogeneous system for Fe(CN)6(3-/4-) capture was constructed based on graphene (GN) and the electropolymeric cationic surfactant, an amphiphilic pyrrole derivative, (11-pyrrolyl-1-yl-undecyl) triethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (A2). The morphology of the system was characterized by scanning electron microscope. The redox properties of the entrapped Fe(CN)6(3-/4-) were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and UV-visible spectrometry. The entrapped Fe(CN)6(3-/4-) exhibited highly electroactive with stable and symmetrical cyclic voltammetric signal. A dramatic negative shift in the half wave potential can be obtained due to the unusual Fe(CN)6(3-/4-) partitioning in in this microheterogeneous system based on poly(A2+GN). Finally, the entrapped Fe(CN)6(3-/4-) was applied in the construction of the enhanced biosensors to hydrogen peroxide and sulfide.
