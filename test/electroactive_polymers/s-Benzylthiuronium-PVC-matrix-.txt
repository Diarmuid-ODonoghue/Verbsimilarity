The construction and characteristic performance of s-benzylthiuronium (s-BT)-PVC membrane sensor responsive for cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) are described. The sensor is based on the use of s-BT-tetraphenylborate (TPB) ion pair as electroactive material in PVC matrix in presence of dioctylphthalate as solvent mediator. The membrane sensor shows a fast, stable and near Nernstian response for CPC over the concentration range of 6 x 10(-6)-1 x 10(-3)M at 25 degrees C and pH range 6-12 with cationic slope of 57.0+/-0.4. The lower detection limit is 4 x 0(-6)M and the response time is 10-30 s. Selectivity coefficients for CPC relative to a number of different species were investigated, which there is negligible intereferences are caused by most of investigated cations, anions, and some organic compounds. The determination of 2.0-350.0 microg/ml of CPC in aqueous solutions shows an average recovery of 98.8%and a mean relative standard deviation of 1.87% at 64.0 microg/ml. The determination of CPC in mouthwash pharmaceutical solution gave results that compare favorably with those obtained by the British pharmacopoeia method. The s-benzylthiuronium electrode has been utilized as an end point indicator electrode for some precipitation titration reactions involving CPC as titrant.
