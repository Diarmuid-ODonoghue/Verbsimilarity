Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is a biocompatible material with excellent electroactive properties. Nonelectroactive α-PVDF and electroactive β-PVDF were used to investigate the substrate polarization and polarity influence on the focal adhesion (FA) size and number as well as on human adipose stem cells (hASCs) differentiation. hASCs were cultured on different PVDF surfaces adsorbed with fibronectin and FA size and number, total adhesion area, cell size, cell aspect ratio and FA density were estimated using cells expressing vinculin fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein. Osteogenic differentiation was also determined using a quantitative alkaline phosphatase assay. The surface charge of the poled PVDF films (positive or negative) influenced the hydrophobicity of the samples, leading to variations in the conformation of adsorbed extracellular matrix proteins, which ultimately modulated the stem cell adhesion on the films and induced their osteogenic differentiation.
