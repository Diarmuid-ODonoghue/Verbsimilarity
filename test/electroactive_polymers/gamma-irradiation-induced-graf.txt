A new method for the fabrication and polymer modification of microelectrodes is described. These electrodes are constructed by heat sealing the electroactive material in dual shrink/melt poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) under vacuum. The PTFE shield may be activated to provide a support upon which polymers of interest may be grafted. gamma-Irradiation was used to graft polymerize styrene to the surface. The poly-(styrene) was subsequently sulfonated with chlorosulfonic acid to form poly(styrenesulfonate). Scanning electron microscopy and Raman microspectroscopy provide evidence that the poly-(styrenesulfonate) film has been formed and extends over the electrode material. Voltammetry indicates that hexaammine-ruthenium(III) cation is preconcentrated and stabilized via an association with the polymer film.
