We report the simultaneous electrochemical detection of dopamine (DA), uric acid (UA) and ascorbic acid (AA) on three dimensional (3D) unmodified 'as-grown' epitaxial graphene nanowall arrays (EGNWs). The 3D few layer EGNWs, unlike the 2D planar graphene, offers an abundance of vertically oriented nano-graphitic-edges that exhibit fast electron-transfer kinetics and high electroactive surface area to geometrical area (EAA/GA≈134%), as evident from the Fe(CN)6(3-/4-) redox kinetic study. The hexagonal sp(2)-C domains, on the basal plane of the EGNWs, facilitate efficient adsorption via spontaneous π-π interaction with the aromatic rings in DA and UA. Such affinity together with the fast electron kinetics enables simultaneous and unambiguous identification of individual AA, DA and UA from their mixture. The unique edge dominant EGNWs result in an unprecedented low limit of detection (experimental) of 0.033 nM and highest sensitivity of 476.2 µA/µM/cm(2), for UA, which are orders of magnitude higher than comparable existing reports. A reaction kinetics based modeling of the edge-oriented 3D EGNW system is proposed to illustrate the superior electro-activity for bio-sensing applications.
