Combining the actuation of conducting polymers with additional functionalities is an interesting fundamental scientific challenge and increases their application potential. Herein we demonstrate the possibility of direct integration of a miniaturized light emitting diode (LED) in a polypyrrole (PPy) matrix in order to achieve simultaneous wireless actuation and light emission. A light emitting diode is used as a part of an electroactive surface on which electrochemical polymerization allows direct incorporation of the electronic device into the polymer. The resulting free-standing polymer/LED hybrid can be addressed by bipolar electrochemistry to trigger simultaneously oxidation and reduction reactions at its opposite extremities, leading to a controlled deformation and an electron flow through the integrated LED. Such a dual response in the form of actuation and light emission opens up interesting perspectives in the field of microrobotics.
