Highly sensitive determination of tumour markers is the key for early diagnosis of cancer. Herein, triple signal amplification strategy resulting from polymer nanospheres, Pt NPs, and DNAzyme was proposed in the developed electrochemical immunosensor. First, electroactive polymer nanospheres were synthesized by infinite coordination polymerization of ferrocenedicarboxylic acid, which could generate strong electrochemical signals due to plentiful ferrocene molecules. Further, the polymer nanospheres were functionalized by Pt NPs and DNAzyme (hemin/G-quadruplex) with the ability of catalyzing H2O2, which contributes to enhance the electrochemical signals. The prepared conjugations were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). And the process of preparation was monitored by zeta potential. Based on the sandwich-type immunoassay, the electrochemical immunosensor was constructed employing the conjugations as signal tags. Under optimal conditions, the DPV peak increased with the increasing of alpha fetal protein (AFP) concentration, and the linear range was from 0.1pgmL(-1) to 100ngmL(-1) with low detection limit of 0.086pgmL(-1). Meanwhile, the designed immunosensor exhibited excellent selectivity and anti-interference property, good reproducibility and stability. More importantly, there were no significant differences in analyzing real clinical samples between designed immunosensor and commercial ELISA.
