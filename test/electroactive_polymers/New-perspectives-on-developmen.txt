Due to the increasing need from the membrane technologies for diverse applications, development of new generation of materials with electroactive properties and significant impact on the future technological systems was imposed. An innovative way of designing the membrane materials with long-term stable hydrophilicity, enhanced workability, porosity, and good biocompatibility, has been adopted by blending of quaternized polysulfone (PSFQ) with a cellulose derivative (cellulose acetate phthalate, CAP). Moreover, the quaternization effect has significantly improved the electrical performances, in terms of the ionic conductivity, electron interactions, and dielectric properties, required by target applications, i.e., ionic-exchange membranes, IEMs. Results derived from dielectric spectroscopy confirm the enhanced dielectric quality, reflected by a low dielectric constant and dielectric loss at high frequency. Additionally, the relationship between the resulted dielectric properties and response at the blood-biomaterial interface, have confirmed their excellent performance, constituting the preliminary basis for future tests concerning their functionality as IEMs in hemodialysis.
