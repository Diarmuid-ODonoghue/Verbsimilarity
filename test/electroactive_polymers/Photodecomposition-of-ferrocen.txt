Accurately characterizing the product of photodecomposition of ferrocene derivatives remains a longstanding challenge due to its structural complexity and strong dependence on the solvent and the substituent. Herein, photodecomposition of ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDC) in methanol is found for the first time to form an electroactive infinite coordinate polymer (ICP) with uniform size, good water stability and photostability, and excellent electrochemical activity. The possible mechanism for the ICP formation is proposed based on the fission of the Fe-ring bond and deprotonation of FcDC under light irradiation. The dissociated Fe(2+) is first oxidized to Fe(3+) that consequently coordinates with the deprotonated ferrocene dicarboxylate to produce ICP nanoparticles. This work not only provides a new insight into the product formation of the photodecomposition of ferrocene derivatives but also offers a mild and simple route to the synthesis of electroactive ICPs.
