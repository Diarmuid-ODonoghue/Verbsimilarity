Protein kinases play a pivotal role in cellular regulation and signal transduction, the detection of protein kinase activity and inhibition is therefore of great importance to clinical diagnosis and drug discovery. In this work, a novel electrochemical platform using the electrochemically mediated polymerization as an efficient and cost-effective signal amplification strategy is described for the highly sensitive detection of protein kinase activity. This platform involves 1) the phosphorylation of substrate peptide by protein kinase, 2) the attachment of alkyl halide to the phosphorylated sites via the carboxylate-Zr4+-phosphate chemistry, and 3) the in situ grafting of electroactive polymers from the phosphorylated sites through the electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (eATRP) at a negative potential, in the presence of the surface-attached alkyl halide as the initiator and the electroactive tag-conjugated acrylate as the monomer, respectively. Due to the electrochemically mediated polymerization, a large number of electroactive tags can be linked to each phosphorylated site, thereby greatly improving the detection sensitivity. This platform has been successfully applied to detect the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) with a detection limit down to 1.63 mU mL-1. Results also demonstrate that it is highly selective and can be used for the screening of protein kinase inhibitors. The potential application of our platform for protein kinase activity detection in complex biological samples has been further verified using normal human serum and HepG2 cell lysate. Moreover, our platform is operationally simple, highly efficient and cost-effective, thus holding great potential in protein kinase detection and inhibitor screening.
