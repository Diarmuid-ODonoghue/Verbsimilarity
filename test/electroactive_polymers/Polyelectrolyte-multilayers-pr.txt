Electronically conducting polyanion and polycation based on poly(alkoxythiophene) derivatives, poly-3-(3'-thienyloxy)propanesulfonate (P3TOPS) and poly-3-(3'-thienyloxy)propyltriethylammonium (P3TOPA) have been synthesized. Both polymers are water-soluble and exhibit high conjugation length in solution and in the solid state. These polyelectrolytes were used to prepare conducting and electroactive polyelectrolyte multilayers by the sequential layer-by-layer adsorption technique. In aqueous solutions multilayers of P3TOPS with inactive polyelectrolytes (e.g., poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), PDADMA) displayed electrochemical and optical behavior similar to polythiophene films prepared in organic media. Their in-plane conductivity was low (ca. 1.6 x 10(-)(5) S cm(-)(1)). The conductivity could, however, be increased by a factor of ca. 40 in "all-thiophene" films, in which P3TOPA was substituted for the inactive polycation (PDADMA). The interpenetration of layers is of prime importance in films containing conducting components. The interpenetration of P3TOPS was studied by measuring the charge-transfer rate across an insulating polyelectrolyte multilayer between the substrate and the P3TOPS layer with modulated electroreflectance. The extent of interpenetration was 8-9 polyelectrolyte layers, the length scale (7-15 nm) depending on the nature of the insulating layer and, especially, on the ionic strength of the solution used for the adsorption of P3TOPS.
