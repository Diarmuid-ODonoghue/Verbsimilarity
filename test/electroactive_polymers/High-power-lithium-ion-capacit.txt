LiMnBO3 nanobeads (LMB-NB) with uniform size and distribution were synthesized using a urea-assisted microwave/solvothermal method. The potential application of LMB-NBs as an anode for a lithium-ion hybrid capacitor (Li-AHC) was tested with a polyaniline-nanofiber (PANI-NF) cathode in a nonaqueous LiPF6 (1â€‰M)-ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge (C/DC) studies revealed that the PANI-NF/LMB-NB cell showed an exceptional capacitance behavior between 0-3 V along with a prolonged cycle life. A discharge capacitance of about 125 F g(-1) , and energy and power densities of about 42 Wh kg(-1) and 1500 W kg(-1) , respectively, could be obtained at a current density of 1 A g(-1) ; those Li-AHC values are higher relative to cells containing various lithium intercalation materials in nonaqueous electrolytes. In addition, the PANI-NF/LMB-NB cell also had an outstanding rate performance with a capacitance of 54 F g(-1) and a power density of 3250 W kg(-1) at a current density of 2.25 A g(-1) and maintained 94% of its initial value after 30000 cycles. This improved capacitive performance with an excellent electrochemical stability could be the result of the morphological features and inherent conductive nature of the electroactive species.
