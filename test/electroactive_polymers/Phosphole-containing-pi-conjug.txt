Two series of 2,5-dipyridyl- and 2,5-dithienylphosphole derivatives containing sigma3- or sigma4-P atoms were prepared, and their optical (UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectra) and electrochemical properties were systematically evaluated. These physical properties depend mainly on the natures of the 2,5-substituents and of the phosphorus moiety, and they revealed that these compounds contain extended pi-conjugated systems. Structure-property relationships were established on the basis of these experimental data and ab initio calculations on the parent molecules. The limited aromatic character and low-lying LUMO of the phosphole ring appear to be crucial for achieving a highly delocalised pi system. Electrooxidation of 2,5-dithienylphosphole derivatives affords electroactive films with low optical band gaps. As observed for the corresponding monomers, the optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers can be varied over a wide range by modifying the nature of the phosphorus moiety.
