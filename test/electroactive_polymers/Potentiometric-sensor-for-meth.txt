A methylene blue (MB) poly(vinyl chloride) membrane sensor based on MB-silicotungstate (SLT) ion association as electroactive material was described. The linear response covered the range 1 x 10(-3)-1 x 10(-6) mol x dm(-3) MB solution, with a slope 52.0+/-0.8 mV decade(-1) (pH range 3.0-10.0). The detection limit was 7.65 x 10(-7) mol x dm(-3). The electrode showed stability, good reproducibility and fast response. Interferences from common inorganic cations, some organic base were negligible. These characteristics of the electrode enabled it to be used successfully for the determination of MB in injection. There was a good agreement for the results of MB content in injection between potentiometric method and USP standard procedure.
