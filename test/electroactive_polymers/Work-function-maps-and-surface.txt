Surface topography and work function maps were simultaneously obtained for carbon surfaces modified by a dendritic molecule: 3,5-Bis (3,5-dinitrobenzoylamino) benzoic acid. The dendrons were spontaneously assembled onto highly ordered pyrolytic graphite samples, exhibiting an increase in the surface potential. This fact is consistent with the incorporation of an electron-acceptor functional group that remains electroactive on the surface.
