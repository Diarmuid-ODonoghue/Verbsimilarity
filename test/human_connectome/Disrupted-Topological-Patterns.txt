Regional abnormalities in brain structure and function, as well as disrupted connectivity, have been found repeatedly in adolescents with conduct disorder (CD). Yet, the large-scale brain topology associated with CD is not well characterized, and little is known about the systematic neural mechanisms of CD. We employed graphic theory to investigate systematically the structural connectivity derived from cortical thickness correlation in a group of patients with CD (N = 43) and healthy controls (HCs, N = 73). Nonparametric permutation tests were applied for between-group comparisons of graphical metrics. Compared with HCs, network measures including global/local efficiency and modularity all pointed to hypo-functioning in CD, despite of preserved small-world organization in both groups. The hubs distribution is only partially overlapped with each other. These results indicate that CD is accompanied by both impaired integration and segregation patterns of brain networks, and the distribution of highly connected neural network 'hubs' is also distinct between groups. Such misconfiguration extends our understanding regarding how structural neural network disruptions may underlie behavioral disturbances in adolescents with CD, and potentially, implicates an aberrant cytoarchitectonic profiles in the brain of CD patients.
