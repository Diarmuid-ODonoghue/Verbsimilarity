Depressive symptoms are commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The underlying mechanisms of depressive symptoms in AD remain unclear; frontolimbic circuitry dysfunction may play a role. We aimed to investigate the microstructural integrity of frontolimbic connectivity of specific fiber tracts in AD patients with and without depressive symptoms using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
