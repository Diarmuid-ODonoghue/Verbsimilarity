22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is the third-largest known genetic risk factor for the development of psychosis. Dysconnectivity has consistently been implicated in the physiopathology of psychosis. Structural covariance of cortical morphology is a method of exploring connectivity among brain regions that to date has not been employed in 22q11DS.
