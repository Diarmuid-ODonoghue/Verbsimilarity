We place a spotlight on the emerging trend of jointly studying the micro- and macroscale organization of nervous systems. We discuss the pioneering studies of Ding et al. (2016) and Glasser et al. (2016) in the context of growing efforts to combine and integrate multiple features of brain organization into a multi-modal and multi-scale examination of the human brain.
