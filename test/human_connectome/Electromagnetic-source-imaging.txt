The goal of this study is to investigate the performance, merits and limitations of source imaging using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings and to compare its accuracy to the results of EEG source imaging. Accuracy in this study, is measured both by determining the location and inter-nodal connectivity of underlying brain networks.
