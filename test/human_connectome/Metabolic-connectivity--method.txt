Metabolic connectivity modelling aims to detect functionally interacting brain regions based on PET recordings with the glucose analogue [F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Here, we outline the most popular metabolic connectivity methods and summarize recent applications in clinical and basic neuroscience.
