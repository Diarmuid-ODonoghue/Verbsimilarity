Up to 20% of individuals with schizophrenia show minimal or no response to medication and are considered to have 'treatment-resistant' schizophrenia (TRS). Unlike early and established schizophrenia, few studies have investigated resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) in TRS. Here, we test for disruptions in FC and altered efficiency of functional brain networks in a well-characterized cohort of TRS patients.
