Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by intrusive thoughts and repetitive, compulsive behaviors. Neuroimaging studies have implicated altered connectivity among the functional networks of the cerebral cortex in the pathophysiology of OCD. However, there has been no comprehensive investigation of the cross-talk between the cerebellum and functional networks in the cerebral cortex.
