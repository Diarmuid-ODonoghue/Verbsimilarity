Recent studies have revealed the possible role of choroid plexus (ChP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). T1-weighted MRI is the modality of choice for the segmentation of ChP in humans. Manual segmentation is considered the gold-standard technique, but given its time-consuming nature, large-scale neuroimaging studies of ChP would be impossible. In this study, we introduce a lightweight segmentation algorithm based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We compared its performance against manual segmentation as well as automated segmentation by Freesurfer in three separate datasets: 1) patients with structural MRIs enhanced with contrast (n = 19), 2) young healthy subjects (n = 20), and 3) patients with AD (n = 20). GMM outperformed Freesurfer and showed high similarity with manual segmentation. To further assess the algorithm's performance in large scale studies, we performed GMM segmentations in young healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project (n = 1,067), as well as healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 509). In both datasets, GMM segmented ChP more accurately than Freesurfer. To show the clinical importance of accurate ChP segmentation, total AV1451 (tau) PET binding to ChP was measured in 108 MCI and 32 AD patients. GMM was able to reveal the higher AV1451 binding to ChP in AD compared with MCI. Our results provide evidence for the utility of the GMM in accurately segmenting ChP and show its clinical relevance in AD. Future structural and functional studies of ChP will benefit from GMM's accurate segmentation.
