How Drosophila larvae select one behavior or a sequence of behaviors, and then persist in the final one, has been addressed by a powerful combination of electron-microscopy reconstruction of neuronal connections, genetic manipulations, electrophysiology, and neuronal modeling. Surprisingly, reciprocal inhibitory synaptic connections are major players in choosing, sequencing and maintaining behaviors.
