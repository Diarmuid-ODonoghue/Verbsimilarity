Recent studies have demonstrated diffusion tensor imaging tractography of cranial nerves (CNs). Spatial and angular resolution, however, is limited with this modality. A substantial improvement in image resolution can be achieved with high-angle diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and atlas-based fiber tracking to provide detailed trajectories of CNs.
