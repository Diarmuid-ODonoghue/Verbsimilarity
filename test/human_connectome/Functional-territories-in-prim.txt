Gaze is strongly attracted to visual objects that have been associated with rewards. Key to this function is a basal ganglia circuit originating from the caudate nucleus (CD), mediated by the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and aiming at the superior colliculus (SC). Notably, subregions of CD encode values of visual objects differently: stably by CD tail [CD(T)] vs. flexibly by CD head [CD(H)]. Are the stable and flexible value signals processed separately throughout the CD-SNr-SC circuit? To answer this question, we identified SNr neurons by their inputs from CD and outputs to SC and examined their sensitivity to object values. The direct input from CD was identified by SNr neuron's inhibitory response to electrical stimulation of CD. We found that SNr neurons were separated into two groups: 1) neurons inhibited by CD(T) stimulation, located in the caudal-dorsal-lateral SNr (cdlSNr), and 2) neurons inhibited by CD(H) stimulation, located in the rostral-ventral-medial SNr (rvmSNr). Most of CD(T)-recipient SNr neurons encoded stable values, whereas CD(H)-recipient SNr neurons tended to encode flexible values. The output to SC was identified by SNr neuron's antidromic response to SC stimulation. Among the antidromically activated neurons, many encoded only stable values, while some encoded only flexible values. These results suggest that CD(T)-cdlSNr-SC circuit and CD(H)-rvmSNr-SC circuit transmit stable and flexible value signals, largely separately, to SC. The speed of signal transmission was faster through CD(T)-cdlSNr-SC circuit than through CD(H)-rvmSNr-SC circuit, which may reflect automatic and controlled gaze orienting guided by these circuits.
