Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term-born infants can lead to memory problems. The hippocampus is important for long-term episodic memory. The primary aim was to investigate the effect of HIE on hippocampal volumes in 9- to 10-year-old children. The secondary aim was to investigate the association between hippocampal volumes and previously found impaired memory and cognitive functions in the current cohort.
