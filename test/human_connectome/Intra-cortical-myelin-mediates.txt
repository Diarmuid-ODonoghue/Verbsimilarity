Differences in myelination in the cortical mantle are important neurobiological mediators of variability in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning. Past studies have found that personality traits reflecting such variability are linked to neuroanatomical and functional changes in prefrontal and temporo-parietal cortices. Whether these effects are partially mediated by the differences in intra-cortical myelin remains to be established.
