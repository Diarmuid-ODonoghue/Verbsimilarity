Human memory is thought to depend on a circuit of connected brain regions, but this hypothesis has not been directly tested. We derive a human memory circuit using 53 case reports of strokes causing amnesia and a map of the human connectome (n = 1000). This circuit is reproducible across discovery (n = 27) and replication (n = 26) cohorts and specific to lesions causing amnesia. Its hub is at the junction of the presubiculum and retrosplenial cortex. Connectivity with this single location defines a human brain circuit that incorporates > 95% of lesions causing amnesia. Lesion intersection with this circuit predicts memory scores in two independent datasets (N1 = 97, N2 = 176). This network aligns with neuroimaging correlates of episodic memory, abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease, and brain stimulation sites reported to enhance memory in humans.
