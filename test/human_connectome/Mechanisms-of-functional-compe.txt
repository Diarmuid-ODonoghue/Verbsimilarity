Mechanisms of functional compensation throughout the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain largely underspecified. By investigating functional connectomics in relation to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers across the pathophysiological continuum of AD, we identify disease-stage-specific patterns of functional degradation and functional compensation.
