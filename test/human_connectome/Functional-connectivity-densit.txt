Functional connectivity density mapping (FCDM) is a newly developed data-driven technique that quantifies the number of local and global functional connections for each voxel in the brain. In this study, we evaluated reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity of both local functional connectivity density (lFCD) and global functional connectivity density (gFCD). We compared these metrics using the human connectome project (HCP) compatible high-resolution (2 mm isotropic, TR = 0.8 s) multiband (MB), and more typical, lower resolution (3.5 mm isotropic, TR = 2.0 s) single-band (SB) resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) acquisitions. Furthermore, in order to be more clinically feasible, only rs-fMRI scans that lasted seven minutes were tested. Subjects were scanned twice within a two-week span. We found sensitivity and specificity increased and reproducibility either increased or did not change for the MB compared to the SB acquisitions. The MB scans also showed improved gray matter/white matter contrast compared to the SB scans. The lFCD and gFCD patterns were similar across MB and SB scans and confined predominantly to gray matter. We also observed a strong spatial correlation of FCD between MB and SB scans indicating the two acquisitions provide similar information. These findings indicate high-resolution MB acquisitions improve the quality of FCD data, and seven minute rs-fMRI scan can provide robust FCD measurements.
