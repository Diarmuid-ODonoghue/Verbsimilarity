Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for the measurement of functional connectivity of the brain. In this context, graph theory has revealed distinctive non-random connectivity patterns. However, the application of graph theory to fMRI often utilizes non-linear transformations (absolute value) to extract edge representations.
