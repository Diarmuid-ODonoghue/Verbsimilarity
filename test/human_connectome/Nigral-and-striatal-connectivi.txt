The study of functional connectivity by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in asymptomatic LRRK2 mutation carriers could contribute to the characterization of the prediagnostic phase of LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to characterize MRI functional patterns during the resting state in asymptomatic LRRK2 mutation carriers.
