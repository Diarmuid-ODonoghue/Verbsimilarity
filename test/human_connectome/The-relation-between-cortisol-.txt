The most common reported seizure-precipitant is stress. We recently showed a biologic basis for stress sensitivity of seizures: cortisol levels in people with stress-sensitive epilepsy correlated with focal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on electroencephalography (EEG). Here we aimed to determine whether the effect of cortisol on the epileptic brain is global or focal, and whether cortisol affects all brains or just those of stress-sensitive people. Because epilepsy is associated with changes in functional brain connectivity, we studied the relationship between cortisol and changes in global and focal (node-centered) functional connectivity measures for individuals with stress-sensitive and non-stress-sensitive epilepsy.
