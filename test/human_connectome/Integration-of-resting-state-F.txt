Integration of functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and structural connectivity analysis based on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) has shown great potential to improve understanding of the neural networks in the human brain. However, there are sensitivity and specificity-related interpretation issues that must be addressed.
