There is a lack of agreement about functional connectivity differences in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies using absolute strength have found reduced connectivity, while those using relative strength--a measure of system topology--reveal mostly enhanced connectivity. We hypothesized that mixed findings may be driven by the metric of functional connectivity.
