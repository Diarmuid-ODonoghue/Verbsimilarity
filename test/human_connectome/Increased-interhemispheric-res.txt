Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a rare movement disorder. The underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully understood. This study aimed to examine the alteration of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between interhemispheric homotopic regions in PKD using a technique called "voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity" (VMHC).
