The connectome of the brain is constructed during foetal life by neurogenesis, arborisation of the neurons and synaptogenesis. The optimal neuronal connections are selected by endogenous spontaneous neuronal activity and sensory input from the external world, particularly after birth. The development of the social brain depends on interaction, particularly with the parents. Infants start to imitate adults from birth and soon learn to recognise faces. They also absorb phonemes like magnets, particularly if they are sitting on their mother's lap and she is speaking motherese. External coupling of the brain to TV, DVDs, iPads and smartphones cannot replace this direct multisensory interaction and does not seem to have the same advantageous effects for children under two years of age that it may have for older children.
