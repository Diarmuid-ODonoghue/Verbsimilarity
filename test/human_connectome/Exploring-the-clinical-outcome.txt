Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic centromedian-parafascicular (CM-Pf) region is the most common target to treat refractory Tourette syndrome (TS), but the improvement among the patients is quite variable. This study describes the outcomes of stimulation in TS patients and attempts to determine whether the volume of tissue activated (VTA) inside the thalamus or the structural connectivity between the area stimulated and different regions of the brain is associated with tic improvement.
