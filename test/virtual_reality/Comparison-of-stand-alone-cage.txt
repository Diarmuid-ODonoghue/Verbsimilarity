After ventral decompression of monosegmental cervical spondylotic stenosis, a stand-alone cage (SC) or cage-with-plate (CP) can be inserted for fusion. Postoperative radiological evaluation can be achieved using different imaging modalities. We retrospectively compared complications, as well as clinical and radiological outcomes for both fusion techniques, and analyzed the possible role of virtual reality (VR) in evaluating the postoperative results.
