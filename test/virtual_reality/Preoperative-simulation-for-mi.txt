Precise assessment of the complex nerve-vessel relationship at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve is useful for planning microvascular decompression in patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. We have applied a fusion imaging technique of three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic resonance cisternography and co-registered 3-D magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) that allows virtual reality for the preoperative simulation of the neurovascular conflict at the trigeminal nerve root entry zone.
