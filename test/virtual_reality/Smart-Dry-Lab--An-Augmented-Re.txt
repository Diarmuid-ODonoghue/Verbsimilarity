Smart Dry Lab (SDL) is a low-cost, AR-based surgical training box, using the ARToolKit API. This is an add-on function for existing surgical training box, which enables quantitative evaluation of forceps maneuver and simulation of soft tissue deformation. In this paper we demonstrate functionality of our prototype system.
