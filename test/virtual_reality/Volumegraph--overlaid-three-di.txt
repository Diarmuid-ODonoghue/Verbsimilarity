We have developed an overlaid three-dimensional image (Volumegraph)-guided navigation system that allows navigation during operative procedures. The three-dimensional image is superimposed on the patient's head and body via a semi-transparent mirror. The Volumegraph can display three-dimensional images in the air by a light beam which is based on CT/MRI.
