Adolescents with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) usually experience psychomotor difficulties that affect their participation in everyday tasks and sports. Without effective intervention, adolescents show persistent motor deficits through adulthood. It is therefore critical to develop interventions to address the specific needs of this population. Studies evaluating the impact of motor interventions among adolescents with DCD are limited.
