The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a pop dance exergaming protocol on fall risk factors-depressive symptoms, fear of falling, and musculoskeletal function-in community-dwelling older female fallers and nonfallers. There were 47 community-dwelling older women assigned to the intervention group (IG) [fallers (n = 10, 69.8 ± 4.3 years); nonfallers (n = 12, 68.9 ± 3.3 years)] and the control group (CG) [fallers (n = 12, 73.6 ± 5.4 years); nonfallers (n = 13, 68.7 ± 4.8 years)]. The CG maintained their lifestyle and the IG performed a videogame dance training three times per week for 12 weeks. The Dance Central game for Xbox 360® and Kinect motion sensor were used. The primary outcomes were geriatric depressive symptoms, fear of falling, and concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque (PT) of quadriceps and hamstrings. Secondary outcomes included cross-sectional area of quadriceps and hamstring muscles, functionality (Timed Up and Go test, gait speed, the Five Times Sit-to-Stand test), and a fall circumstances and outcomes recording. The depressive symptoms decreased in the Intervention Fallers Group. The eccentric hamstrings PT at 180°/s increased in the Intervention Nonfallers Group. There were no significant differences between groups for the other variables analyzed. The training attendance was 83% for the Intervention Fallers Group and 88% for the Intervention Nonfallers Group. Dance exergaming can be indicated to decrease depressive symptoms in fallers and increase the PT in nonfallers among community-dwelling older women.
