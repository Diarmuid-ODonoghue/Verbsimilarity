Balance disorders affect a large number of older people, leading to falls. To promote independence, self-care and the quality of living of the long-lived population, an innovative solution is devoped to act as a virtual trainer for people that suffer from vestibular dysfunction related balance disorders. Our solution offers a virtual balance therapy, supported by Information and Communication Technology devices, to monitor user's activity during the day and provide real time feedback for the correct execution of physiotherapy exercises. Wearable sensors are utilized to monitor user activity, while during the execution of exercises, cameras are used to track the body of the user. An Augmented Reality headset is used to project the virtual trainer's 3D avatar in front of the user, providing real time guidance for the correct execution of the exercises.
