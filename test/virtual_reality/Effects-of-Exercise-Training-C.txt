Objective: The progression of chronic kidney disease can directly affect patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Exercise training is a good option to reverse the impacts caused by the disease. To escape from the monotonous routine and stimulate further practice, the therapist should consider making physical activity more playful. Using videogames during exercise training is possible to rehabilitate the patient aiming for fun beyond the organic condition. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise training combined with Virtual Reality (VR) in functionality and HRQoL of patients on hemodialysis. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled study in which control group (n = 20) maintained only hemodialysis without any physical effort or intervention from the researchers and intervention group (n = 20) who performed endurance and strength physical exercises in combination with VR during hemodialysis for 12 weeks. All eligible patients underwent a familiarization of games and were evaluated by an investigator-blind for functional capacity, quality of life, and depressive symptoms. Functional capacity tests included walking speed, timed up and go (TUG), and Duke Activity Status Index (DASI). To evaluate a HRQoL, Kidney Disease and Quality-of-Life Short-Form (KDQOL-SF™, v. 1.3) was used and to investigate depressive symptoms, the Center for Epidemiological Scale-Depression. Paired sample t-tests were conducted to determine differences within each group. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (group vs. time) was used to assess group differences in our major outcomes. The level of significance was 5%. Results: The exercise improved functional capacity (TUG: P = 0.002, DASI: P < 0.001) and HRQoL in physical and specific domains: physical functioning (P = 0.047), role physical (P = 0.021), as well as in physical composite summary (P < 0.001) and effects of kidney disease (P = 0.013). There was no influence on depressive symptoms (P = 0.154). Conclusion: Physical training combined with VR improved functional capacity and some quality-of-life domains of hemodialysis patients.
