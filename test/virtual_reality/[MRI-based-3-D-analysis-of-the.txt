Until now, pathological translation of the glenohumeral joint could not be assessed three-dimensionally and in functionally important arm positions in the living. The objektive of this study was therefore to develop an MR-based technique for determining the three-dimensional glenohumeral translation in functionally relevant positions in vivo.
