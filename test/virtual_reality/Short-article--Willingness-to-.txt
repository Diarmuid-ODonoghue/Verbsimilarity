This study explored the willingness of patients to start colonoscopy with virtual reality (VR) instead of procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA), as well as their motives and characteristics. There is a growing interest in colonoscopy without PSA. Offering VR as a distraction technique instead of PSA may increase the percentage of colonoscopies without PSA.
