By integrating medical science with cutting edge simulation and training technologies, realistic prosthetic tissue, wounds, and part task trainers have been developed for the training of trauma care clinicians. The next generation of Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) includes the use of prosthetics developed based on human anatomy and physiology, material science, and nanotechnology. Testing has revealed that these products are highly useful and reliable.
