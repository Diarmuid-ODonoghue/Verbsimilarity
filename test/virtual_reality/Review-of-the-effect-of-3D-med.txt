It is necessary to incorporate novel training modalities in medical education, especially in surgical fields, because of the limitations of cadaveric training. Traditional medical education has many drawbacks, such as residency working hour restrictions, patient  safety  conflicts  with  the  learning  needs,  and  the  lack  of  hands-on  workshops.  The  MedTRain3DModsim  Project  aimed  to  produce 3-dimensional (3D) medical printed models, simulations, and innovative applications for every level of medical training using novel  worldwide  technologies.  It  was  aimed  herein  to  improve  the  interdisciplinary  and  transnational  approaches,  and  accumulate  existing experience for medical education, postgraduate studies, and specialty training.
