The construction industry has a high risk of occupational accidents and injuries. More randomised controlled trials are needed to identify effective techniques for improving the occupational safety of construction sector workers. New technologies such as virtual reality (VR) offer the potential to develop engaging learning tools for safety training. Although the number of VR applications in occupational safety training is increasing, only a few studies have evaluated the learning outcomes of VR safety training. Furthermore, previous studies indicate that learning to recognise human factors at work has positive outcomes for safety skills. However, there is lack of knowledge regarding the efficacy of human factors-related training in the construction industry.
