Driving ability can be compromised in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS); however, the progressive nature of multiple sclerosis makes it difficult for clinicians to assess when performance on functional tasks, such as driving, has started to decline. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between two measures of multiple sclerosis severity, the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, and minor driving errors in a virtual reality driving simulator.
