Training for robot-assisted thoracic lobectomy remains an issue, prompting the development of virtual reality simulators. Our aim was to assess the construct and face validity of a new thoracic lobectomy module on the RobotiX Mentor, a robotic surgery simulator. We also aimed to determine the acceptability and feasibility of implementation into training.
