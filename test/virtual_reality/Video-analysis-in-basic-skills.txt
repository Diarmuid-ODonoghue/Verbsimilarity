Basic skills training in laparoscopic high-fidelity simulators (LHFS) improves laparoscopic skills. However, since LHFS are expensive, their availability is limited. The aim of this study was to assess whether automated video analysis of low-cost BlackBox laparoscopic training could provide an alternative to LHFS in basic skills training.
