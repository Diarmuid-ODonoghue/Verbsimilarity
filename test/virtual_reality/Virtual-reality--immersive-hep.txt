Understanding the spatial relationships among the liver segments, and intrahepatic portal and hepatic veins is essential for surgical treatment of liver diseases. Teleimmersive virtual reality enables improved visualization over conventional media because it supports stereo vision, viewer-centered perspective, large angles of view, and interactivity with remote locations. We report a successful pilot study teaching hepatic surgical principles using teleimmersion.
