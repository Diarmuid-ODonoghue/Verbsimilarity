Cadaveric dissection is the gold standard for training physicians in various surgical specialties. However, limitations in acquiring and storing sufficient cadaveric material, recent pressures in training opportunities, and progress in digital image technology have led to advances in virtual or artificial visual means to augment surgical training. For training neurosurgeons, the appearance of reality is still crucial for learning anatomic structures and procedures. We developed a four-dimensional (including time) multilayer digital image reconstruction technology (MIGRT) that allows users to manipulate a "volumetric" set of photographic image data from exquisite cadaveric intracranial dissections and to navigate through stages of neurosurgical procedures as the dissection progresses.
