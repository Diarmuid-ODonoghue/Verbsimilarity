Training on a virtual reality (VR) simulator has been shown to improve the performance of VR endoscopic tasks by novice endoscopists. However, to our knowledge the translation of VR skills into clinical endoscopic proficiency has not been demonstrated. We established criterion validity for a VR ureteroscopy simulator by evaluating VR trained subjects in a cadaver model.
