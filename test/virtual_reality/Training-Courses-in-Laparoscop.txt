For the acquisition of skills in laparoscopic surgery, practices in experimental labs are gaining increasing relevance. Activities in experimental labs include Pelvitrainers, virtual reality simulators, and experimental animals (frequently pigs). However, the best model for surgical formation is the performance of interventions on cadavers. The Thiel method gives the body elasticity, which allows the performance of laparoscopic procedures.
