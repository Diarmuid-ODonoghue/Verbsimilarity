There is conflict regarding the benefits of greater amounts of intensive upper limb rehabilitation in the early period post-stroke. This study was conducted to test the feasibility of providing intensive therapy during the early period post-stroke and to develop a randomized control trial that is currently in process. Specifically, the study investigated whether an additional 8â€‰h of specialized, intensive (200-300 separate hand or arm movements per hour) virtual reality (VR)/robotic based upper limb training introduced within 1-month post-stroke resulted in greater improvement in impairment and behavior, and distinct changes in cortical reorganization measured via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), compared to that of a control group.
