Augmented reality (AR) uses the real-world setting but enables a person to interact with virtual objects. In this study, we aimed to explore the use of alphabet letter and number in an AR task and its influence in reaction time in a population with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) compared with the performance of typical developing (TD) controls. We evaluated reaction time before and after AR tasks that consisted of identifying correct numbers and alphabet letters in 48 people with ASD and 48 with TD controls. Results indicate that total points for TD group were higher (M = 86.4 and M = 79.0) when compared with the ASD group (M = 54.5 and M = 51.5) for alphabet letters and numbers, respectively. Moreover, in analysis of reaction time results, only the ASD group showed an improvement in performance after the practice of an AR task. The control group was faster before (M = 553.7) and after (M = 560.5) when compared with the ASD group (M = 2616.0 and M = 2374.6, respectively). Despite the need for further studies, our results support that there is potential for clinical use of an AR task-based intervention for people with ASD.
