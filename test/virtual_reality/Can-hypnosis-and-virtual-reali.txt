Different non-pharmacological techniques, including hypnosis and virtual reality (VR) are currently used as complementary tools in the treatment of anxiety, acute and chronic pain. A new technique called virtual reality hypnosis (VRH), which encompasses a combination of both tools, is regularly used although its benefits and underlying mechanisms remain unknown to date. With the goal to improve our understanding of VRH combination effects, it is necessary to conduct randomised and controlled research trials in order to understand their clinical interest and potential benefits.
