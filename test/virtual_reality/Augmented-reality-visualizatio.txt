The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and performance of an augmented reality (AR) visualization prototype for virtual computed tomography (CT)-guided interventional procedures in a multimodality abdominal phantom. With the aid of AR guidance, three radiologists performed 30 attempts at targeting simulated liver lesions of different sizes (range, 5-15 mm) with a biopsy needle. The position of the needle tip relative to the lesion was verified by using ultrasonography and CT. With AR guidance, lesions were successfully targeted with the first needle pass in all cases. On the basis of these results, AR visualization for CT-guided intervention appears feasible and allows intuitive and accurate lesion targeting in a phantom.
