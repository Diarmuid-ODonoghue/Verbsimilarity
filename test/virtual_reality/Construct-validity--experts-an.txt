This study was undertaken to establish construct validity of the Xitact LS500, a virtual reality laparoscopic cholecystectomy simulator. The primary research statement is: "The clip-and-cut task on the Xitact LS500 virtual reality laparoscopic cholecystectomy simulator mimics the surgical procedure of the clipping and cutting of the cystic duct and artery during the laparoscopic cholecystectomy adequately."
