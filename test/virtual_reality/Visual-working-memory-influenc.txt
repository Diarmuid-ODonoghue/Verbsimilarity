This study addresses for the first time the relationship between working memory and performance measures in image-guided instrument navigation with Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) and GI Mentor II (a simulator for gastroendoscopy). In light of recent research on simulator training, it is now prime time to ask why in a search for mechanisms rather than show repeatedly that conventional curriculum for simulation training has effect.
