Our previous study indicated that treatment in multiple contexts (MC) improved the outcome of exposure treatment by reducing return of fear. This effect was evident when the test was conducted immediately post treatment. In the present study, we conducted a treatment analogue study where we investigated whether an exposure to multiple stimuli (MS) and a combination of both MS and MC would further improve treatment efficacy in the short and long terms.
