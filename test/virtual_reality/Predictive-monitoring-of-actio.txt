Error-related negativity (ERN) is a signal that is associated with error detection. Joch and colleagues (Joch M, Hegele M, Maurer H, MÃ¼ller H, Maurer LK. J Neurophysiol 118: 486-495, 2017) successfully separated the ERN as a response to online prediction error from feedback updates. We discuss the role of ERN in action and suggest insights from virtual reality techniques; we consider the potential benefit of self-evaluation in determining the mechanisms of ERN amplitude; finally, we review the oscillatory activity that has been claimed to accompany ERN.
