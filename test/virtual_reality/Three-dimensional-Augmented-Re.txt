We attempted to evaluate the clinical efficiency of a novel three-dimensional interactive augmented reality system (3D-ARS) for balance and mobility rehabilitation. This system enables participant training with a realistic 3D interactive balance exercise and assessing movement parameters and joint angles by using a kinetic sensor system. We performed a randomized controlled trial in a general hospital. Thirty-six participants (age, 56-76 years) who could independently walk and stand on one leg were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either group. The control group (n = 18) underwent a conventional physical fitness program such as lower-extremity strengthening and balance training thrice per week for 1 month. The experimental group (n = 18) experienced 3D-ARS training thrice per week (1 session = 30 minutes) for 4 weeks. Training comprised a balloon game for hip exercise, cave game for knee exercise, and rhythm game for one-leg balance exercise. Lower-extremity clinical scale scores, fall index, and automatic balance score were measured by using Tetrax® posturography before, during, and after training. Significant group (3D-ARS vs. control) × time (before and after exercise) interaction effect was observed for Berg balance scale (BBS) scores (p = 0.04) and timed-up-and-go (TUG; p < 0.001). Overall improvements occurred in stability index, weight distribution index, fall risk index, and Fourier transformations index of posturography for both groups. However, score changes were significantly greater in the 3D-ARS group. Significant group × time interaction effect was observed for the fall risk index. This demonstrates that the 3D-ARS system can improve balance in the elderly more effectively.
