Since the landmark studies of Patel and Terasaki, pretransplant identification of donor-directed HLA alloantibodies (DSAs) has been a critical prelude to renal allograft transplantation. Pretransplant, DSAs may be an acceptable risk or an unconditional contraindication to transplantation depending on the particular donor : recipient combination. Posttransplant, DSAs are associated with episodes of acute rejection, chronic rejection, and graft loss. Thus, monitoring for such antibodies is an important aspect of patient care.
