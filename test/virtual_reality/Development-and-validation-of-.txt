Neuroendoscopic surgery using an ultrasonic aspirator represents a valid tool with which to perform the safe resection of deep-seated ventricular lesions, but the handling of neuroendoscopic instruments is technically challenging, requiring extensive training to achieve a steep learning curve. Simulation-based methods are increasingly used to improve surgical skills, allowing neurosurgical trainees to practice in a risk-free, reproducible environment. The authors introduce a synthetic, patient-specific simulator that enables trainees to develop skills for endoscopic ventricular tumor removal, and they evaluate the model's validity as a training instrument with regard to realism, mechanical proprieties, procedural content, and handling.
