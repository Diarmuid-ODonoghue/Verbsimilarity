The 12-week home-based virtual cycling training (hVCT) improved lower limb muscle strength and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) than the control program in children with cerebral palsy (CP). A muscle strengthening program, rather than general physical activity, is more specific in enhancing aBMD for these children. A novel hVCT is an effective and efficient strategy that enhances lower limb bone density in these children.
