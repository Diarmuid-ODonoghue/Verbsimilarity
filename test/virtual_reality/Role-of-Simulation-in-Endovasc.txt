Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) requires a high-level of technical-competency to avoid device-related complications. Virtual reality simulation-based training (SBT) may offer an alternative method of psychomotor skill acquisition; however, its role in EVAR training is undefined. This study aimed to: a) benchmark competency levels using EVAR SBT, and b) investigate the impact of supervised SBT on trainee performance.
