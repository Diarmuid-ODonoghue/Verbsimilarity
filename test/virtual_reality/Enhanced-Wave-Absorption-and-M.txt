A cobalt sulfide/PVDF(Polyvinylidene Fluoride) composite was prepared by a simple blending method, and the microstructure of the composite was investigated through X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Increased absorption properties at frequencies ranging from 2 GHz to 18 GHz were studied, and the mechanical properties were investigated via tensile tests and finite element method simulations. The results indicated that the cobalt sulfide/PVDF composites exhibited strong microwave absorption intensities (-43 dB at 6.6 GHz) with a low filler loading (5.0 wt%). The elastic modulus increased with the cobalt sulfide mass fraction. Cobalt sulfide could improve the mechanical properties of the composite, especially in the lengthwise direction.
