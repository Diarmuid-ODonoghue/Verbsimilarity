Simulation is a useful adjunct to skills-based training. It potentially avoids risk to patients during training and development of basic interventional techniques. This may be of particular relevance in colonoscopy where the learning curve can be long. Several endoscopic devices exist that simulate colonoscopy for training purposes. This study was designed to review the evidence for the validity of these simulators.
