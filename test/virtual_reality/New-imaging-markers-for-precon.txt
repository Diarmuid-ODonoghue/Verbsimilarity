The availability of imaging makers of early placental circulation development is limited. This study aims to develop a feasible and reliable method to assess preconceptional and early first-trimester utero-placental vascular volumes using three-dimensional power Doppler (3D PD) ultrasound on two different Virtual Reality (VR) systems.
