This study was undertaken to establish the value of the Advanced Dundee Psychomotor Tester (ADEPT) as an objective real-time scoring system, correcting for subjective assessor opinion on endoscopic task performance. The main research questions were as follows: Are surgeons good estimators of their own performance on ADEPT? Do surgeons perceive ADEPT to be a valid instrument for measuring laparoscopic skills? Does performance on ADEPT reflect innate psychomotor ability?
