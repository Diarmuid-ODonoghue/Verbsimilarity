In laparoscopy, suboptimal ergonomics frequently lead to morbidity for surgeons. Physical complaints are more commonly reported on the dominant upper extremity. This may be the consequence of challenging laparoscopic tasks being easier to perform with the dominant side. The authors hypothesized that specific training of the nondominant upper extremity may equip this side better and lead to a more equal distribution of physical load.
