Medially pointing aneurysms of the ophthalmic segment of the internal carotid artery (oICA) represent a neurosurgical challenge. Conventional ipsilateral approaches require internal carotid artery and optic nerve (ON) mobilization as well as anterior clinoidectomy (AC), all associated with increased surgical risk. Contralateral approaches could provide a better exposure of the superomedial aspect of the oICA, ophthalmic artery, and superior hypophyseal artery, sparing AC and internal carotid artery or ON mobilization. However, the microsurgical anatomy of this approach has not been systematically studied. In the present work, we exhaustibly analyzed the anatomic and morphometric characteristics of contralateral approaches to the oICA and compared them with those from ipsilateral approaches.
