There is a pressing demand for improving the quality and efficacy of health care and social support services needed by the world's growing elderly population, especially by those affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type early-stage dementia. Meeting that demand can significantly benefit from the deployment of innovative, computer-based applications capable of addressing specific needs, particularly in the area of cognitive impairment mitigation and rehabilitation. In that context, we present here our perspective viewpoint on the use of virtual reality (VR) tools for cognitive rehabilitation training, intended to assist medical personnel, health care workers, and other caregivers in improving the quality of daily life activities of people with MCI and AD. We discuss some effective design criteria and developmental strategies and suggest some possibly useful protocols and procedures. The particular innovative supportive advantages offered by the immersive interactive characteristics inherent to VR technology are discussed.
