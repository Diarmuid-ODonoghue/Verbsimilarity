This study aimed to determine the effect of methods of distraction to relieve pain associated with the peripheral intravenous catheter (PIC) insertion procedure, thus improving patient satisfaction. Specifically, we examined such effect by playing 3D videos with virtual reality goggles and showing pictures to the patient containing distractive optical illusions.
