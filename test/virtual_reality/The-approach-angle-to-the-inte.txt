The interoptic triangle (IOT) offers a key access to the contralateral carotid artery's ophthalmic segment (oICA) and its perforating branches (PB), the ophthalmic artery (OA), and the superior hypophyseal artery (SHA). It has been previously reported that the assessment of IOT's size is relevant when attempting approaches to the contralateral oICA. However, previous studies have overseen that, since the oICA is a paramedian structure and a lateralized contralateral approach trajectory is then required, the real access to the oICA is further limited by the approach angle adopted by the surgeon with respect to the IOT's plane. For this reason, we determined the surgical accessibility to the contralateral oICA and its branches though the IOT by characterizing the morphometry of this triangle relative to the optimal contralateral approach angle.
