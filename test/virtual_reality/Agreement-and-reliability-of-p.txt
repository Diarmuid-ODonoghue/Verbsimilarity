Imaging of the levator ani hiatus provides valuable information for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). This study compared measurements of levator ani hiatal volume during rest and on maximum Valsalva, obtained using conventional three-dimensional (3D) translabial ultrasound and virtual reality imaging. Our objectives were to establish their agreement and reliability, and their relationship with prolapse symptoms and POP quantification (POP-Q) stage.
