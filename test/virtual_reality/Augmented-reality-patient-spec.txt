The objective of this work is to develop a preoperative reconstruction plate design system for unilateral pelvic and acetabular fracture reduction and internal fixation surgery, using computer graphics and augmented reality (AR) techniques, in order to respect the patient-specific morphology and to reduce surgical invasiveness, as well as to simplify the surgical procedure.
