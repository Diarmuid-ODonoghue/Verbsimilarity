Methamphetamine associated psychosis (MAP) represents a mental disorder induced by chronic methamphetamine use in a subset of users. The prevalence of the disorder has increased in several countries in Europe and Asia where methamphetamine use has increased. MAP remains difficult to distinguish from primary psychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia, creating complications in prescribing treatment plans to patients.
