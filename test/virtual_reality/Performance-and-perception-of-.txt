The benefit of haptic feedback in laparoscopic virtual reality simulators (VRS) is ambiguous. A previous study found 32% faster acquisition of skills with the combination of 3 D and haptic feedback compared to 2 D only. This study aimed to validate perception and effect on performance of haptic feedback by experienced surgeons in the previously tested VRS.
