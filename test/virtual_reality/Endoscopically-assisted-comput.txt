Performing accurate anatomical reconstruction is a challenging task in the treatment of internal orbital floor fractures. Compared with traditional transcutaneous incisions, endoscopic transmaxillary approaches have the advantage of avoiding complications related to external scars, and provide direct access to the orbital floor. Autogenous bone provides the ideal material for defect reconstruction, but determination of the correct size and shape of the graft is crucial for a stable support. This study introduces a new protocol for the treatment of internal orbital floor fractures that combines endoscopy, virtual reality, and 3D printing. The authors also investigated the impact of computer-aided surgery (CAS) on the overall accuracy of reconstruction in aiming to achieve the triple objective of restoring anatomy, volume, and function.
