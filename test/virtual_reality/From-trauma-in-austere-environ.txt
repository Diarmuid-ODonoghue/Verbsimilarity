Surgical and simulation development have always been closely associated with military activity. The last ten years have continued that trend, allowing for training in real time, under reality-based conditions, learning technical and clinical skills with the dynamic of true human factors and team training in the actual environment. We present data from diverse activities in three separate scenarios: second-year medical students in clinical scenarios; the U.S. Ski Team physicians training in austere conditions; the U.S. Navy Fleet Surgical Team training for sea and land deployment.
