People with multiple sclerosis (MS) who undergo rehabilitation need to perform new motor skills or relearn old motor skills. It is not clear whether people with MS retain the ability to improve motor performance or learning. Furthermore, factors that influence motor performance in people with MS need to be investigated. This study explored motor performance in people with MS using virtual reality (VR). The effect of fatigue and cognitive function on motor performance improvement in people with MS was investigated.
