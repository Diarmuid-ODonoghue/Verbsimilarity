Minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized the field of surgery over the past several decades. Specifically, robotic surgery is increasingly being used for complex operations, although the appreciable learning curve required to become proficient has deterred many surgeons. We describe how use of a proficiency-based training program can decrease the learning curve and lead to standardized robotic surgery.
