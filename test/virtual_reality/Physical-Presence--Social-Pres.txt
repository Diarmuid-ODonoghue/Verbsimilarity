Although social anxiety disorders (SADs) are increasingly treated by means of virtual cue exposure, the mechanisms leading to sufficient anxiety levels and thus to a success of virtual reality exposure therapy are still poorly understood. Also, most studies with SAD participants fail to evaluate social presence, although it may be a more appropriate indicator for virtual social stress scenarios than physical presence. Hence, for the first time, this study sets out to examine the link between social presence, physical presence, and emotional responses to phobogenic virtual social stimuli. A group of n = 12 participants with SAD and n = 12 healthy controls were exposed to three social tasks in an interactive virtual environment (VE). Self-report measures of physical and social presence as well as state anxiety were used alongside heart rate measures to evaluate the virtual experience. Results show significantly higher anxiety levels-both self-report and physiological-in SAD participants than in controls. Also, socially anxious subjects reported to experience more copresence and mutual attention as well as a higher sense of being in the VE than their healthy peers. In sum, social presence experiences may be more predicative of the anxiety response in SAD individuals than physical presence. Especially attentional processes seem to crucially shape the interplay between presence and affective responses.
