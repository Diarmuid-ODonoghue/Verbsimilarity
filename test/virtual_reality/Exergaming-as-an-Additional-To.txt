Objective: To assess the effectiveness of home videogame-based exercise (exergaming) as an additional rehabilitative tool in young patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Materials and Methods: After a baseline (T0) evaluation, 40 RA inpatients (18-35 years of age) underwent both a 4-week-lasting traditional rehabilitation program and a training by Nintendo® Wii-Fit™ videogame system. At discharge (T1), subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to two groups: Group A (experimental group), including subjects who continued Wii-Fit training at home for additional 8 weeks, and Group B (control group), including subjects maintaining their habitual activity during the 8-week follow-up (T2). Measures of disease activity, quality of life, and fatigue were evaluated at each time point. Results: From T0 to T1, a significant improvement in most evaluated outcomes was reported in both study groups. At T2 assessment, only Group A patients experienced a significant improvement of quality of life and fatigue, with a 13.4% reduction in Global Health (GH) values, only a slight increase (4.2%) in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, and a 19.1% Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) improvement as compared with T1. In contrast, Group B patients reported a 65.8% increase in GH values, a 33% increase in HAQ score, and a 53.4% reduction in FACIT values from T1 to T2. The extended videogame-based home training was an independent predictor of Δ%GH (β = 0.851; P < 0.001), Δ%HAQ (β = 0.542; P < 0.001), and Δ%FACIT (β = -0.505; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Home exergaming may be an effective additional rehabilitative tool in RA, since it allows to maintain the benefits of traditional multidisciplinary rehabilitation.
