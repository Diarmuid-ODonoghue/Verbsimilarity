Convergence insufficiency may be treated by visual exercises designed to increase convergence while maintaining single, clear, binocular vision. However, compliance with treatment is problematic, as patients often cease treatment when symptoms start to improve and before treatment is complete. The purpose of the present study was to assess the feasibility of using gamification of vision training to: (a) treat convergence insufficiency; and (b) improve compliance to treatment in comparison to a conventional treatment over a six-week treatment period.
