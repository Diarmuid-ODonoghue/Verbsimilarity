In this paper, we present a fully-customized AR display design that considers the user's prescription, interpupillary distance, and taste of fashion. A free-form image combiner embedded inside the prescription lens provides augmented images onto the vision-corrected real world. The optics was optimized for each prescription level, which can reduce the mass production cost while satisfying the user's taste. The foveated optimization method was applied which distributes the pixels in accordance with human visual acuity. Our design can cover myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia, and allows the eye-contact interaction with privacy protection. A 169g dynamic prototype showed a 40° × 20° virtual image with a 23 cpd resolution at center field and 6 mm × 4 mm eye-box, with the vision-correction and varifocal (0.5-3m) capability.
