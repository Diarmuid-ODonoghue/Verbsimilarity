Mitral valve (MV) annuloplasty is an integral part of MV repair, but sizing under direct vision is occasionally challenging. Furthermore, traditional sizing is not possible for percutaneous MV repair techniques. This study compared augmented reality-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for determining MV annuloplasty size with conventional surgical sizing.
