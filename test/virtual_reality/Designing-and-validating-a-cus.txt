We developed and instituted a laparoscopic skills curriculum based on a virtual reality simulator, LapSim (Surgical Science, GÃ¶teborg, Sweden). Our goal was to improve basic skills in our residents. The hypothesis of this study is that performance in our course will differentiate levels of experience in the training program, establishing construct validity for our curriculum.
