Human posture is controlled by a combination of vestibular, somatosensory and visual information. This paper is concerned with postural readjustment responses induced by vection. In the visual control of posture, visually-induced perception of self-motion plays an important role and is called vection. Vection is difficult to measure quantitatively because it is a highly subjective phenomenon.
