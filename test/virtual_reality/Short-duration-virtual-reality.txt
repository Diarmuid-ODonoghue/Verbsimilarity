Several studies have demonstrated skills transfer after virtual reality (VR) simulation training in laparoscopic surgery. However, the impact of VR simulation training on transfer of skills related to laparoscopic colectomy remains not investigated. The present study aimed at determining the impact of VR simulation warm-up on performance during laparoscopic colectomy in the porcine model.
