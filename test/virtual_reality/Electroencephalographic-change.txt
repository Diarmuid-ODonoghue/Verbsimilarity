The aim of the study was to describe the technique of an electroencephalographic (EEG) assessment using the Emotiv EPOC® during the performance of a virtual reality motor task and compare theta, alpha, beta and gamma power frequencies between left and right hemispheres. This is technical note in which 9 healthy young subjects were submitted to an evaluation with Emotiv EPOC® during the Nintendo® Wii 'Basic Step' virtual game using the Wii Balance Board (WBB) on a support 13 centimeters high. The Wilcoxon statistical test was applied and pairing between the cerebral hemispheres was performed. Participants had a mean age of 22.55 ± 2.78 years, 77.8% were right-handed, and 22.8% had no experience with the selected virtual game. According to dominancy (right handed n = 7; and left handed n = 2), it was observed that the right-handed individuals showed significantly greater difference in the right hemisphere in the EEG in front region (gamma power in channels AF4, p = 0.028 and F4, p = 0.043) and parietal region (theta and beta power in P8 channel, p = 0.043), while alpha power showed a greater activity in the left hemisphere (P7 channel, p = 0.043). Considering the inter-hemispheric analysis, it was observed that the right hemisphere presented a higher activation potential in the frontal lobe for gamma waves (p = 0.038 for AF3-AF4 channels), and in the temporal lobe for beta and alpha waves (p = 0.021). This study showed that the virtual environment can provide distinct cortical activation patterns considering an inter-hemispheric analysis, highlighting greater activation potential in the right hemisphere.
