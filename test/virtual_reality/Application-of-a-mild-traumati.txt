Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can compromise reaction time, visual perception, memory, attention, balance, and gait. These deficits, especially if persistent, can restrict participation in daily activities and the resumption of personal and profession roles. The purpose of this case study is to describe an mTBI-specific clinical assessment and rehabilitation intervention administered in a virtual reality environment.
