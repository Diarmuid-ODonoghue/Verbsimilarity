Electronic interactive learning environments can enhance the learning experience and may prove beneficial in basic life support (BLS) training. As part of the European Union funded project "JUST-in-time health emergency interventions-training of non-professionals by virtual reality and advanced IT tools", an innovative interactive CD-ROM on BLS and other emergency medicine topics was developed. We hypothesised that individuals without previous BLS training could learn CPR techniques from this CD.
