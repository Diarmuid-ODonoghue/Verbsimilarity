Vestibular input is projected to "multisensory (vestibular) cortex" where it converges with input from other sensory modalities. It has been assumed that this multisensory integration enables a continuous perception of state and presence of one's own body. The present study thus asked whether or not vestibular stimulation may impact this perception.
