Laparoscopic basic skills are best trained in the nonclinical setting. Box trainers and virtual-reality trainers have been shown to be useful in training laparoscopic skills. Certain nonsurgical skills may predict baseline skills in these trainers. This study tested the hypothesis that baseline scores could be predicted in inanimate box trainers and virtual-reality trainers by nonsurgical skills.
