In liver surgery planning, 2D and desktop-based 3D systems offer surgeons limited assistance. By using VR technology to liberate 3D from 2D input devices such as the mouse and keyboard, this surgery planning system better supports surgeons. User studies show that the system is both effective and easy to use.
