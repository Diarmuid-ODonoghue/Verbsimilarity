Here we introduce a new virtual reality (VR) based simulation system for training the urological procedure of intra-detrusor botulinum toxin (BotoxÂ®) injections into the bladder. 6 cases with different bladder anatomy and 3 subtasks are included in the curriculum; this design is guided by several expert urologists according to clinical needs and experience. These virtual bladder models can be deformed by a cystoscope model or penetrated by a needle model. Data of location and dose per injection are collected during the training. After compared among various options, magnetic motion-tracking devices are chosen and integrated onto replicas of cystoscopic instruments as the VR interface for the specific operation. A web/database based learning management platform (LMP) is developed for online data access and validation studies of the training system.
