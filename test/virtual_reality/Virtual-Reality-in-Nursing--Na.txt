A virtual reality (VR) based training simulator developed for nasogastric tube (NGT) placement is presented. It leverages the advantages of VR technology - safety, flexibility, interactivity and quantitative assessment - to speed up the learning curve of NGT placement. The simulator demonstrates the potential of VR for nurse education.
