Surgical approaches to the orbit are challenging and require combined multispecialist skills. Considering its increasing relevance in neurosurgical practice, keyhole surgery could be also applied to this field. However, mastering a minimally invasive approach necessitates an extended learning curve. For this reason, virtual reality (VR) can be effectively used for planning and training in this demanding surgical technique.
