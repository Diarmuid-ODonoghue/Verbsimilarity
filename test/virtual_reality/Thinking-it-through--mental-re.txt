Simulation-based training (SBT) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCCY) provides an opportunity for junior residents to learn the procedure in a safe, nonthreatening environment. Mental rehearsal (MR) has the potential of augmenting skill acquisition. This project investigated the correlation between MR of LCCY with performance on 2 different types of simulators: a procedural task (PT) training model and virtual reality (VR) machine.
