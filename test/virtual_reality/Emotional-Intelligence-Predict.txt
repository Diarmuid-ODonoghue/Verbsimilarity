Self-assessment is fundamental in surgical training. Accuracy of self-assessment is superior with greater age, experience, and the use of video playback.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether emotional intelligence or visual-spatial aptitude can predict effective self-assessment among novice surgeons performing laparoscopic appendectomy (LA).
