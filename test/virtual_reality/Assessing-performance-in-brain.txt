NeuroTouch is a virtual reality (VR) simulator developed for neurosurgical skill training. Validation demonstrating that the system is useful and reliable is required for formal adoption into training curriculums. Face and content validity have been demonstrated for some neurosurgical simulators, but construct validity remains difficult to establish. A pilot validation study was conducted for a NeuroTouch training exercise.
