Many patients undergoing dental treatment have experienced pain associated with the treatment and become anxious and/or fearful of treatment. Anxiety and fear have conventionally been managed with the use of inhalation anesthesia or tranquilizers. However, their physical effects must also be considered, and they will not be suitable for all patients. The purpose of the present study was to assess the clinical effect of virtual reality (VR) to relieve anxiety during impacted mandibular third molar extraction under local anesthesia.
