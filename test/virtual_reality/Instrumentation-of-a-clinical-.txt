This paper describes the instrumentation of a clinical colonoscope needed for a novel colonoscopy simulation framework. The simulator consists of a compact and portable haptic interface and a virtual reality environment to provide real-time visualization. The proposed instrumentation enables tracking different functions of the colonoscope while keeping the ergonomics unchanged.
