Light field displays based on integral imaging feature ultra-compact volume and freedom of the vergence-accommodation conflict for advanced virtual reality and augmented reality devices; however, they currently suffer from low visual resolution. Considering that subpixels have an intrinsically tripled resolution compared with triad pixels, this Letter develops a subpixel-level algorithm by recombining subpixels with relatively small raytracing errors from different elemental images. As a result, based on a highly accurate image formation model, the resolution of a typical system (pixel size, 7.8 μm; system thickness, 4.07 mm) is remarkably enhanced from 8.3 to 20.0 pixels per degree, for a gain of 2.41. In addition, the color breakup introduced by the chromatic subpixels is largely suppressed.
