Exaggerated blood pressure (BP) response to behavioral stress has been recognized as an independent predictor of increased BP levels in human subjects. The coupling of dopamine receptor type 1 (DRD1) with stimulatory G-proteins plays an important role in BP regulation. Therefore, we investigated whether the A-48G polymorphism of the DRD1 gene and the T393C polymorphism of the Gs protein alpha subunit (GNAS) gene influenced BP levels at rest and in response to stress.
