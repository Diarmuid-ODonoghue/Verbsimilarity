Foraminal cervical nerve root compression can be caused by lateral disk herniation or osteophyte formation of the vertebrae. Improved diagnosis and evaluation can be achieved using different imaging techniques: radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging. We retrospectively evaluated the potential influence of a virtual reality (VR) visualization technique on surgery planning and evaluation of postoperative results in patients with monosegmental, unilateral osseous cervical neuroforaminal stenosis.
