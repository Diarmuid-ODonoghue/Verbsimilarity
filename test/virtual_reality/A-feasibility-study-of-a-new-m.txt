The advantage of augmented reality (AR) is the combination of virtual reality, three-dimensional display and real-time interaction. Traditional augmented reality navigation systems lack the solution for deep perception and display errors. This study is designed to compare the different situation between the traditional image guide pattern and deviation-reminder pattern in the model trials. The deviation-reminder pattern is adding the position and rotation deviation in the scene. The AR system can track the model and surgical tools at the same time. Five craniofacial surgeons and engineers participated in this study. The navigation points were ensured with the traditional image guide pattern and deviation-reminder pattern for each one. Then, the position error, orientation error and time requirement were recorded for statistical analyses in the study. There was a statistically significant difference between the deviation-reminder pattern and traditional image guide pattern for both engineers and surgeons in orientation error and navigation time (p < 0.05). Additionally, there were no significant differences between engineers and surgeons in errors (p = 0.117) and time requirements by the team (p = 0.913). Our results suggest that the deviation-reminder pattern is better than traditional image-guided pattern for both engineers and surgeons. In addition, the extra information can improve the performance of surgeons in navigating position assurance.
