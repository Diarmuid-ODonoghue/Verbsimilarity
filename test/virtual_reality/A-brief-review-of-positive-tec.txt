The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of positive technology to productively and positively transform the mental health of European and American citizens in the modern era. This work will describe three aspects - hedonic, eudaimonic, and social/interpersonal - of these technologies. We approach them with guarded optimism, as all of them seek to improve our lives through various techniques. After exploring the relevant technologies, this piece will then examine the future for research within this domain.
