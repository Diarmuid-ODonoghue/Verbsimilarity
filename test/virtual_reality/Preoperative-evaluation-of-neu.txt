In this paper the authors' goal was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a virtual reality (VR) system in preoperative planning for microvascular decompression (MVD) procedures treating idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm. The system's role in surgical simulation and training was also assessed.
