Initial studies have shown the potential of video capture virtual reality (VR) systems for rehabilitation. However, it is important to continue to investigate the utility of novel VR intervention techniques for treating motor deficits. The aim of the current study was to determine the effectiveness of the VMall, a virtual supermarket on a video capture system as an intervention tool to treat the weak upper extremity of people with stroke.
