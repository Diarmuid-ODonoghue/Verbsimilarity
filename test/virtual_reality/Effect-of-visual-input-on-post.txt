Chronic motion sensitivity (CMS) has been defined as a feeling of un-wellness elicited by either actual or perceived motion. CMS is a common condition and is more prevalent in females than in males. In addition to a variety of symptoms, young adults with CMS have less postural stability than those without CMS.
