Social competence is often impaired in children with acquired brain injury (ABI), but evidence-based rehabilitation has remained undeveloped. This pilot-study aimed to create a structured model for sociocognitive rehabilitation for children with ABI. A total of 32 children aged 8-13â€‰years participated: 22 with ABI -epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, or tic disorder and 10 healthy controls. Interactive computer-based applications were implemented into rehabilitation design using multitouch-multiuser tabletop (MMT) devices: Snowflake MultiTeach (MT) and Diamond Touch Table (DTT), plus MediqVR virtual reality (VR) platform. At baseline, patients demonstrated social incompetence compared to healthy controls. Post-training evaluations showed that rehabilitation on Snowflake MT improved children's executive and cooperation skills. DTT developed new communication and language skills, metacognitive skills, and coping with difficult social situations. This structured model for social competence rehabilitation helps therapists to understand the objectives and tools for improving social and cooperation skills in children with ABI. We provide practical recommendations using next-generation devices, which are effective and motivating for children.
