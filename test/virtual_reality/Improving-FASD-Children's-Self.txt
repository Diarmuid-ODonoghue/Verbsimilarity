The initial parent training component of GoFAR, an intervention designed to improve the self-regulation and adaptive living skills of children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, was piloted in a small, randomized clinical trial of 28 participants assigned to either a time-lapsed control group or one of two parent training groups who differed on whether the child's computerized instruction was congruent or incongruent with the parent instruction. Parental compliance and achievement of therapy goals were indicators of improvement in the child's self-regulation skills. Children who received computerized instruction consistent with the parent training demonstrated greater self-regulation improvements than those receiving incongruent computerized instruction.
