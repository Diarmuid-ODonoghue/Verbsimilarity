Balance disorders, fatigue, and walking impairments are the most common symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), which lead to a decrease in quality of life. To cope with these disability-increasing symptoms, it is important to select and regularly apply appropriate rehabilitation approaches. In recent years, virtual reality approaches have been suggested as a potentially useful tool in rehabilitation. Exergaming systems are used in the treatment of symptoms associated with MS, but there are few randomized controlled studies investigating the efficacy of these systems.
