Neurosurgery in areas with restricted space and complicated anatomy can be greatly aided by the virtual reality (VR) technique. The clivus represents one of such challenging surgical areas, but its VR has not been established. The present study aimed to document a VR model of clival anatomy that may be useful in clival surgery.
