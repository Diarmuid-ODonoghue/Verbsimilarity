The general principles and current applications of pediatric video-assisted cardiothoracic surgery (PVACTS) are reviewed. The purpose of PVACTS is to improve surgical quality and precision in selected operations. In the 1990s PVACTS has expanded to include the management of a variety of pulmonary, mediastinal, and cardiac lesions. Currently, PVACTS is carried out using a video camera connected to a low-profile scope and a specialized set of surgical instruments. PVACTS is an accepted modality for the diagnosis (by biopsy) of pleuropulmonary and mediastinal disease, and the treatment of pediatric empyema, spontaneous pneumothorax, and mediastinal cysts. Diaphragmatic plication, repair of chylous leak, and ligation of collateral vessels have all been done using PVACTS. PVACTS patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation and vascular ring repair are being successfully carried out in several institutions. The technique at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is described. Indications and techniques for PVACTS lobectomy and pneumonectomy are less well established. Suggested anecdotal methods are described. Cardioscopy carries the hope of improving intracardiac repair, and has been applied to several lesions. The future of PVACTS depends on the surgeon's willingness to master it, industry's willingness to customize instruments for pediatric use, and developments in the fields of virtual imaging and augmented reality.
