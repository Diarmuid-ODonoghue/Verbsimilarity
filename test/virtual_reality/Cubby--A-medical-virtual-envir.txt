In this paper a desktop virtual reality system named Cubby is described. Cubby is based on self-induced, head-coupled movement parallax on three orthogonal screens. It is argued that this system is better suited to medical practice than Immersive VR solutions or single screen Desktop VR systems. Whilst Cubby is currently limited to visualisation it opens up possibilities of direct instrumental manipulation and as such could prove useful as a medical simulator.
