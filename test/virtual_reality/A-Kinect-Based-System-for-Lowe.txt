This work brings together the emerging virtual reality techniques and the natural user interfaces to offer new possibilities in the field of rehabilitation. We have designed a rehabilitation game based on a low cost device (Microsoft Kinect(TM)) connected to a personal computer. It provides patients having Parkinson's Disease (PD) with a motivating way to perform several motor rehabilitation exercises to improve their rehabilitation. The experiment was tested on seven Parkinson's Disease patients and results demonstrated significant improvements in completion time score and in the 10 Meters Walk Test score. Nevertheless, additional research is needed to determine if this type of training has a long-term impact. Both the device and protocol were well accepted by subjects, being safe and easy to use. We conclude that our work provides a simple and suitable tool resulting in a more enriching rehabilitation process where motivation is highly encouraged in PD patients. Feedback coming from participants corroborate the hypothesis that the system can be applied not only in clinical rehabilitation centers but at home.
