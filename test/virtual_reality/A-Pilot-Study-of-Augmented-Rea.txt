We developed an acetabular cup placement device, the AR-HIP system, using augmented reality (AR). The AR-HIP system allows the surgeon to view an acetabular cup image superimposed in the surgical field through a smartphone. The smartphone also shows the placement angle of the acetabular cup. This preliminary study was performed to assess the accuracy of the AR-HIP system for acetabular cup placement during total hip arthroplasty (THA).
