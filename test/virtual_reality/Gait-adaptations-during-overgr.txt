Virtual reality (VR) has been used to study locomotor adaptability during balance-demanding tasks by exploring how humans react and adapt to the virtual environment (VE) and discordant sensorimotor stimulations. Previous research primarily focused on treadmill walking and little is known regarding the propensity for gait adaptations during overground walking and over time.
