The tibial drill-guide angle in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction influences the tunnel placement and graft-tunnel force, and is potentially associated with post-operative tunnel widening. This study aimed to examine the effect of the drill-guide angle on the stress redistribution at the tibial tunnel aperture after anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction.
