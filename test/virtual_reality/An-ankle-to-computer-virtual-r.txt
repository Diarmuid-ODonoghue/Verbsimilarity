Repetitive practice improves function and facilitates cortical plasticity after stroke. Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to provide motivating and safe repetitive practice with minimal supervision. The purpose of this case study is to look at the effect of a VR system, activated by surface electromyography of dorsiflexors and plantarflexors, on gait velocity, function, and kinematics.
