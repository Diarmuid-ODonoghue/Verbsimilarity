In Parkinson's disease executive functions are altered. We used a Virtual Reality version of the Multiple Errand Test in order to evaluate decision-making ability in 12 patients and 14 controls. Patients with Parkinson's disease, even if not-demented, showed strategies full of errors, suggesting that impulse control disorder, very frequent in course of disease, could precede cognitive dysfunctions.
