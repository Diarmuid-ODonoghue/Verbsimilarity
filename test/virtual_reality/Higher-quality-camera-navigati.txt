To objectively assess the quality of laparoscopic camera navigation (LCN), the structured assessment of LCN skills (SALAS) score was developed and validated for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The aim of this pre-clinical study was to investigate the influence of LCN on surgical performance during virtual cholecystectomy (vCHE) using this score.
