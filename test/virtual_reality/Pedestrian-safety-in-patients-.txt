Patients with Parkinson's disease experience debilitating motor symptoms as well as nonmotor symptoms, such as cognitive dysfunction and sleep disorders. This constellation of symptoms has the potential to negatively influence pedestrian safety. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of motor symptoms, daytime sleepiness, impaired vigilance, and cognitive dysfunction with pedestrian behavior in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy older adults.
