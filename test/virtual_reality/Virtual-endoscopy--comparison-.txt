A new technique has been described which combines abdominal helical computed tomography (CT) scanning and virtual reality computer technology, known as virtual colonoscopy (VC); the reconstructed images provide a simulation of the interior of the colon as viewed by endoscopy. We compared VC with conventional colonoscopy in patients with suspected or known colonic neoplasia.
