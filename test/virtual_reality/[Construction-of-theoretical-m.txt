In the process of transforming and upgrading of traditional Chinese medicine( TCM) intelligent manufacturing,the TCM enterprises lack systematic and in-depth research on intelligent manufacturing of TCM,leading to insufficient understanding of relevant concepts,development direction,development content and other aspects,to some extent,causing fuzzy and chaotic phenomena. The theoretical model,as a higher expression level of scientific thinking,has the function of interpretation and prediction,and can provide theoretical basis as well as guide for scientific research. Therefore,this article aims to construct a theoretical model of TCM intelligent manufacturing based on the concept of flexible production and intelligent equipment for some unhealthy phenomena in the development process of TCM intelligent manufacturing. In the TCM intelligent manufacturing system,with theory model as the core,the new-generation information technology was integrated with the TCM manufacturing technology to realize the integration of informationization and industrilization as well as the landing of theoretical model. Then,a 3 D simulation model was established to provide a visual environment for intelligent manufacturing of TCM and simulate the virtual reality throughout the TCM intelligent manufacturing process. The new theoretical model in this paper,to a certain extent,can play a guiding role in the development of TCM intelligent manufacturing,and can also provide reference for the realization of TCM intelligent manufacturing.
