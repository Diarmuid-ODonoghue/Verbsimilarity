Pediatric headache is highly widespread and is associated with distress and reduced quality of life. Pharmacological treatment of chronic headache in children has been only partially effective and, as in medication-overuse headache, can sometimes be counterproductive. Therefore, there is a substantial need to develop other effective methods of treatment. Here we present the rationale, feasibility, and preliminary results of a pilot study applying a novel system, combining virtual reality and biofeedback, aimed as an abortive treatment of pediatric chronic headache.
