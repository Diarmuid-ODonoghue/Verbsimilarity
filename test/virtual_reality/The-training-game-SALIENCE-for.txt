The feasibility study was aimed to develop a web-based gaming tool for the therapy of alcohol use disorder to offer patients a cue-exposure-based extinction and decision training, enhanced with virtual reality. To increase the training effect, patients playfully experience situations that resemble critical real-life situations. For implementing the game, a combination of HTML5 and JavaScript was used. The application comes with an administrator interface, to allow editing the game content. Initially, we included 21 patients (Group 1), 18 suffering from alcohol use disorder and 3 using cannabis (18/3 male/female, mean age 39 ± 13 years). Considering the iterative process of a feasibility study, we developed the game design as suggested by participants of Group 1 and additionally included 11 novel participants (Group 2) (11 suffering from an alcohol use disorder, 7/4 male/female, mean age 46 ± 14 years). Basically, the game was very well received. Usability ratings were generally high, even in patients with little computer experience. Both groups rated the application as realistic, and would generally be willing to play it on a daily basis. Given that SALIENCE is inexpensive, easily available, and engaging, it might be a reasonable add-on intervention to the standard treatment of alcohol use disorder.
