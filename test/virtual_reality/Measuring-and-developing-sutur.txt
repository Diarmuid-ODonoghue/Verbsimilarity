We have developed an interactive virtual reality (VR) surgical simulator for the training and assessment of suturing technique. The surgical simulator is comprised of surgical tools with force feedback, a 3-dimensional graphics visual display of the simulated surgical field, physics-based computer simulations of the tissues and tools, and software to measure and evaluate the trainee's performance.
