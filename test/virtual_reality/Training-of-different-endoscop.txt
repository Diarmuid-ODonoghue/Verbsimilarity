Virtual reality simulator and ex vivo animal models are used for training of both basic and advanced endoscopic techniques. The aim of this study was to assess whether hands-on training on ex vivo animal model improves endoscopic skills. Four different endoscopic techniques were practiced: endoscopic resection, endoscopic stenting, application of the over-the-scope (OVESCO) clip, and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).
