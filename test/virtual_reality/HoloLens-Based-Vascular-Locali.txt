Vascular localization is crucial for perforator flap transfer. Augmented reality offers a novel method to seamlessly combine real information with virtual objects created by computed tomographic angiography to help the surgeon "see through" the skin and precisely localize the perforator. The head-mounted display augmented reality system HoloLens (Microsoft) could facilitate augmented reality-based perforator localization for a more convenient and safe procedure.
